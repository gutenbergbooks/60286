<h3 class='c003'>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h3>

<p class='c008'>This pamphlet of 46 8vo pages was published by the author himself in 1806.
The title-page was ‘Free Thoughts on Public Affairs, or Advice to a Patriot; in
a Letter addressed to a Member of the Old Opposition. London, Printed by
Taylor &amp; Co., Shoe Lane, and sold by J. Budd, Crown &amp; Mitre, Pall Mall, 1806.’
Mr. W. C. Hazlitt reprinted the pamphlet from the author’s own copy in 1885
(Bohn’s Library, <cite>The Spirit of the Age, etc.</cite>), and that reprint forms the text of
the present edition. The pamphlet is exceedingly rare. Mr. Alexander Ireland
knew of only one copy, that which belonged to Mr. W. C. Hazlitt. This he
caused to be transcribed; but it has not been possible to collate the present text
with either the original or Mr. Ireland’s transcription.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir, If the opposition of character between the individuals of
different nations is that which attaches every one the most strongly to
his own country; if the love of liberty instilled from our very cradle
is any security for the hatred of oppression; if a spirit of independence,
and a constitutional stubbornness of temper are not forward to
crouch under the yoke of unjust ambition; if to look up with heartfelt
admiration to the great names, whether heroes or sages, which
England has produced, and to be unwilling that the country which
gave birth to Shakespear and Milton should ever be enslaved by a
mean and servile foe; if to love its glory—that virtue, that integrity,
that genius, which have distinguished it from all others, and in
which its true greatness consists,—is to love one’s country, there are
few persons who have a better right than myself (on the score of
sincerity) to offer that kind of advice which is the subject of the
following letter, however weak or defective it may be found.</p>

<p class='c010'>To love one’s country is to wish well to it; to prefer its interests
to our own; to oppose every measure inconsistent with its welfare;
and to be ready to sacrifice ease, health, and life itself in its defence.
But there is a false kind of patriotism, loud and noisy, and ever ready
to usurp that name from others, as an honourable covering either for
selfish designs or blind zeal, to which I shall make no pretensions.
It has been called patriotism, to flatter those in power at the expense
of the people; to sail with the stream; to make a popular prejudice
the stalking-horse of ambition, to mislead first and then betray; to
enrich yourself out of the public treasure; to strengthen your influence
by pursuing such measures as give to the richest members of the
community an opportunity of becoming richer, and to laugh at the
waste of blood and the general misery which they occasion; to defend
every act of a party, and to treat all those as enemies of their country
who do not think the pride of a minister and the avarice of a few of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>his creatures of more consequence than the safety and happiness of a
free, brave, industrious, and honest people; to strike at the liberty of
other countries, and through them at your own; to change the
maxims of a state, to degrade its spirit, to insult its feelings, and tear
from it its well-earned and proudest distinctions; to soothe the follies
of the multitude, to lull them in their sleep, to goad them on in their
madness, and, under the terror of imaginary evils, to cheat them of
their best privileges; to blow the blast of war for a livelihood in
journals and pamphlets, and by spreading abroad incessantly a spirit
of defiance, animosity, suspicion, distrust, and the most galling contempt,
to make it impossible that we should ever remain at peace or
in safety, while insults and general obloquy have a tendency to
provoke those passions in others which they are intended to excite.</p>

<p class='c010'>Being then of opinion, that to flatter is not always the duty of a
friend; that it is no part of the love of one’s country to be blind to
her errors, or to wish her to persist in them; I may take the liberty
of stating freely such observations as have occurred to an unprejudiced
but not indifferent spectator on the present state of things: and there
is at least this advantage in reflections which are not the echo of the
popular cry, that something may be found in them, however unsupported
or frivolous in general, which may be turned to good account
by persons of sounder judgment and more extensive means of information.
It has been said that ‘there is wisdom in a multitude of
counsellors;’ but if they only raise a clamour by repeating all of them
the same thing, I do not see how this advantage can be obtained.</p>

<p class='c010'>What I would chiefly remark upon is,—How far the principles
and views acted upon by the late administrations are such as to afford
us the safest and most honourable ground for prosecuting a war which
is said to be carried on for the existence of the empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Had I to engage with an enemy in a struggle of this kind, the
ground which I should choose to occupy would be such a one as that
he must feel himself to be the aggressor. In a conflict which is to
decide the fate of a people, I think the greatest care should be taken
to remove all doubtful or frivolous causes of debate, to suffer no
sinister motives to divert their minds from the great object in which
they are engaged or lessen their steady confidence in the justice of
their cause. It is hardly to be expected that the mass of a people
should defend the patrimony of independence which they inherit from
their ancestors with the reverence, intrepidity, and dauntless zeal
required of them, when they see a minister ready to gamble it away
for the first idle object that excites his cupidity, or opens a door to
the spirit of intrigue. Examining the conduct of those who were the
advisers and authors of the late renewal of hostilities according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>these maxims, which seem to me well founded, it is not easy to
imagine any thing more remote from true dignity, magnanimity, or
wisdom, than the manner in which we chose to enter upon a war on
which we were to stake our all. We chose to rest a dispute, which
was to involve every thing near and dear to us, on a diplomatic
ambiguity; on a technical question, as to the manner how and to
whom we were to give up a barren rock which was of no use to us,
and to which we had resigned all pretensions. It was clear that we
had refused to fulfil our share of a treaty which had been formally
ratified; but the reasons which we gave for doing this were by no
means equally clear and satisfactory. They sounded more like the
excuses of those seeking a pretence for the continuance of an unsuccessful
contest, than the remonstrances of persons sincerely anxious
for peace, and opposed by real difficulties. I remember at the time
when the design of retaining Malta was first made known, every one’s
remark was,—Had we not agreed to give it up? And as to the
official reasons for this change of measures, which were afterwards
detailed to the public with such pomp and circumstance, viz., that it
was to have been given up to the Order that formerly possessed it
only on the supposition of that Order’s remaining entire, though no
such condition had been expressed, and under the guarantee of another
power whose consent had neither been asked or obtained, I believe
that no one who was not either indifferent to peace or desirous of war
ever thought them of sufficient consequence to justify us in exposing
ourselves to unnecessary reproach and odium, and plunging into a sea
of unknown troubles. It is certain that by the generality of people
they could neither be felt nor understood. On this tottering foundation
did Mr. Addington think proper to take his stand. Doubt,
perplexity, evasion, a general indifference as to the immediate object
of the dispute, and a direct accusation of breach of faith on the part
of the enemy were the auspices under which we were to begin a war,
which ought (from the tremendous consequences attached to it) to
have had no motives but what came home to the bosoms and businesses
of men; to every manly, generous, and honest feeling; that might
not have been uttered boldly without fear of contradiction in the face
of an enemy; that must not have beat in every heart, have strung
every arm, and animated every tongue. If the situation of the
country was believed to be at all precarious; if there was even a
chance that the contest might really lead to the dreadful alternative
held out to us, the want either of cautious prudence or of manly
wisdom in ministers was at that time inexcusable. It is no part of
wisdom to hang the fate of kingdoms in the balance with straws. It
is no part of courage to fight, to show that you are not afraid of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>fighting. Calm steady courage does not distrust itself; nor is it
afraid that by giving up a trifling or doubtful point, it may afterwards
be bullied into dangerous compliances. Firmness and moderation
seem to me not only not incompatible with each other, but that the
one is a necessary consequence of the other. On the other hand,
meanness and pride are nearly allied together. In common life we
should think that a readiness to seize the first occasion of quarrel
shewed a man to be either a bully or a coward; it would seem as if
he was afraid that by deferring his resentment he should either want
courage or opportunity for shewing it another time. Yet the great
excuse for our going into the war was,—that by yielding any thing to
the demands of the enemy, we should soon lose all power of resistance,
and crouch in abject submission at his feet. This was not a proud
confidence in ourselves, but a mean dread of our own pusillanimity
and want of firmness. It was to suppose that we had no security for
our firmness, but in the heat of our passions and the infliction of
mutual injuries. But it may be said, that whatever was the cause
of the war, the consequences were the same. The critical situation
in which we stood, and the threats of the enemy made it necessary
for us to repel force by force, to call forth every energy of which we
were possessed, and to stand forth as one man in defence of the
country. But whatever this might prove as to the conduct of the
people, it forms no justification of the conduct of ministers. It was
not the danger of invasion which produced the taking up arms, but
the determination to take up arms which produced the fear of invasion.
The threatened invasion was not the cause of the war, but the consequence
of it. This reasoning, as applied to the commencement of
the war is preposterous. It is the same absurdity as to give yourself
an infectious disease in order that you may call in the physician,
instead of calling in the physician because you are attacked by the
disease. It is ridiculous, I say, to argue that the war was necessary
to repel the horrors and ravages of invasion; when, if the war had
not taken place, no such evils would have been possible. It was true,
that so long as we determined to carry on the war, it was necessary
to guard ourselves against the consequences of war; but to suppose
(which seemed to be generally the case with the good people of
England in the height of their panic) that to doubt for a moment
of the necessity of the war was the same thing as wishing that the
French might come here and put every one to the sword (when one
chief object of peace would be to prevent all such wild alarms), implies
such an intricate confusion of ideas as I am not able to unravel. At
least I can account for it only in one way; by supposing that this
reluctance to distinguish between the necessity of our going to war,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>and the necessity of self-defence, brought upon us by it, arose from a
deep consciousness in the human mind of the importance of the
motives by which we have been actuated to the success of our undertakings,
and a belief that he who lessens your confidence in the
grounds of your proceeding, thereby unnerves your resolution, and
lessens your safety. I know that immediate danger, however incurred,
produces the same necessity for self-defence; but it does not produce
the same temper of mind and motives for going through it. It may
also produce the same mechanical courage at the moment; but perseverance,
superiority to fear or disaster, self-confidence, a cheerful
determined submission to the greatest hardships and sufferings from a
sense that they were unavoidable, ‘the unconquerable will, and courage
never to submit or yield, and what else is not to be overcome;’ all
these are not in the gift of fear, or folly, or ignorance, or hatred. It
is therefore of the highest consequence to ascertain the true grounds
and motives of a war, such as the present, and to know the spirit and
sentiments by which it was brought about, and to what part of our
character, whether to its strong or its weak side, whether to our vices
or our virtues, those motives were addressed which called forth our
ardour and readiness to engage in it. It is not from loud boasting,
from what we think or say of ourselves, but from what we really are;
not from a pretended, but real love of justice, of independence, of
honour, and of our country’s welfare, that we can expect the fruits of
victory. If we find in those who lead, no higher principle of action
than a wish to serve their own interests, or gratify their own passions,
and in those who are led, only that zeal which arises from the drunken
uproar of an ale-house, the low credulity of ignorance, or the idle
vanity of wearing a red coat and shouldering a firelock—I will not
say that the situation of the country is desperate indeed, but I think
it is not such as to afford the most solid grounds of confidence in our
security against a spirit of unbounded ambition; the insolence of
almost unexampled success, resentment for supposed injuries, and the
most consummate military skill. ‘The still small voice is wanting.’...
It is not in the order of nature that an administration acting
upon such principles as I have here described should feel, or be
capable of inspiring into others, either true patriotism, a sincere and
manly spirit of independence, or any particle of that high-souled
energy, which is necessary to contend with inordinate ambition,
armed with strength and cunning. That administration is no more:
I trust that its spirit has not survived it!</p>

<p class='c010'>It seems almost impertinent at present to turn back to the diplomatic
pedantry and legal quibbling by which the retention of Malta was so
gravely justified at the time. After the repeated declarations that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>have been made in parliament, and after having witnessed those tragical
events, to which, it seems, it was the necessary prelude, there can be
little doubt as to the real motives of that measure. From these
motives then we are to form our opinion of the conduct of ministers.
If it was a wise and necessary measure to plunge Europe again into
the calamities of war, to bathe it once more in that ‘fountain of
blood,’ then and then only was our refusing to fulfil our engagements
a wise and necessary determination; for the now avowed reason of
our going to war was, that we might not remain at peace! Here
then was a war voluntarily undertaken for its own sake, peace studiously
shunned, and all the evils consequent upon such a step incurred, for
the sake of making one more desperate effort to reduce the power of
France and humble it with the dust. We therefore entered upon this
wild Quixotic scheme at our own peril, and the responsibility of the
war devolved upon us. We ought therefore to have had strong
grounds, either from a confidence in the result or from the justice of
the principle, for making such an attempt. But we have seen what
has been the result with respect to the other powers of Europe, it
remains to be seen how it will terminate with respect to ourselves.
As to the justice and generosity of the design, I may perhaps speak
of that hereafter.</p>

<p class='c010'>I will not pretend to censure the general practice of obtaining a
war <em>under false pretences</em>, I leave it to the politicians to settle the rules
of honour among themselves: but I cannot help thinking that in a
war which is to try the spirit of a people, they ought not to be tricked,
or bullied, or unnecessarily forced into it. With respect to the
suspension of the war in consequence of the treaty of Amiens, it
certainly had this good effect (on the supposition that it was absolutely
necessary to go on with the contest), that it gave those who had been
enemies of the old war, and had been afterwards disgusted by the
conduct of the French, but did not like to relinquish their opinion
while the original cause of dispute remained—it gave all persons of
this class (of which there were great numbers) an opportunity to quit
the ranks of discontent without exposing themselves to the charge of
inconsistency. As it was a new war, they thought they had a fair
right to have a new opinion about it; and they exercised their freedom
of election as eagerly in approving the conduct of ministers in entering
upon the present war, as they had done in condemning their continuance
of the former one. For myself, I confess I have always
looked upon the present war as a continuance of the last, carried on
upon the same principles and for the same purposes, only without any
hopes of success, and therefore infinitely more wanton and foolish.
For as, in the commencement of the last war, it was our intention to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>conquer France, in this we can only hope to defend ourselves. Of
the necessity of this defence there can be but one opinion. But to
confound this with the necessity of the war itself, or to argue as if the
discontinuance of the war would increase the dangers arising from it,
is an improvement in political logic, a luminous arrangement of ideas,
that must have crept in with the benefits of the Union.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first plea that was made use of to give a colouring of interest
to the renewal of hostilities, before the discovery of that profound
train of policy, the explosion of which has left Europe a heap of
ruins, was, that after the incautious surrender of Malta, it had been
found to be of much greater importance to Great Britain than had
been imagined at the time; and that it could not be suffered to fall
into the hands of the French, or even become subject to their influence,
without endangering one of the chief sources of the wealth and
prosperity of this country. It seems Malta was the enchanted island,
into which Buonaparte was to convey himself by stealth, and thence
passing easily into Egypt was, at another vast stride, to come down
<em>souse</em> upon our possessions in India. With these resting-places, and
the help of the thousand-league boots which our imagination had lent
him, the political magician was to take but a hop, step and a jump,
from one hemisphere into the other. Or, in the language of the day,
Malta was the key to Egypt, and Egypt was the key to our Eastern
conquests. Both the points assumed in this statement were directly
denied, and their fallacy exposed at the time by one to whose authority
or reasonings on the subject I can add nothing; but I may be
permitted to make one general remark with respect to this part of the
subject, that if the mere possibility of the loss of an object of national
aggrandisement is to be considered as a sufficient ground of war, there
never could be such a thing as peace among mankind. If one party
is to be kept in a state of perpetual alarm from a distant apprehension
of losing the superiority they possess in wealth, or luxury, or power,
and the other to be perpetually goaded on by the hope of speculative
plunder; if one party is determined to forgo nothing, and the other to
grasp at everything; if future causes of contention are to be anticipated,
and we are to fight now to defend an object that may never
come into dispute hereafter; if we are not to wait till we see and feel
our danger, but to create it out of every fantastic occasion; if our
selfishness must be of that refined calculating comprehensive kind as
to overlook no possibility of danger or advantage however remote or
uncertain, and at the same time so inflexibly disinterested as to think
no sacrifices too great in pursuit of its favourite object—it is easy to
see that the world would soon be dispeopled. It is well for mankind
that our passions naturally circumscribe themselves, and contain their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>own antidote within them. The only excuse for our narrow, selfish
passions is their short-sightedness: were it not for this, the jealousies
of individuals and of nations would never leave them a moment’s
interval of rest or quiet. It is well that the headlong passions which
make us rush on our own destruction and that of others are only
excited by gross, palpable objects; and are therefore transient and
limited in their operation. It is well that those motives which owe
nothing to reason in their birth should not afterwards receive either
nourishment or support from it. If in their present desultory state
they produce so many mischiefs, what would be the case if they were
to be organized into systems, and under the direction of pure abstract
reason? Any object that provoked a momentary resentment or
excited our jealousy might plunge us into a war that could only be
expiated by seas of blood. But in a war of mere interest or passion,
it is surely allowable to sit down and count the cost, and to strive to
moderate our pride and resentment instead of inflaming them. Virtue,
truth, and patriotism require nothing of us but an inviolable resolution
and integrity in the defence of those rights which are the common
privilege of humanity; the rest is a calculation of prudence, not a
stern command of duty that admits neither of compromise or delay.
To defend at the point of the sword, and at the risk of every thing
valuable, our title to the possessions that are neither necessary nor
durable in their own nature, that are never worth a hundred years’
purchase, that may crumble to pieces of their own accord, or slip out
of our hands in various ways before the end of the contest, and which
afterwards will be no more secure ‘against infection and the hand of
war,’ against the insidious or desperate designs of the enemy, against
the breath of accident or unforeseen decay than they were before—is
madness and folly. It is to defeat the intended favours of Fortune,
by paying for them before-hand a price much greater than they can
ever be worth. It is to squander away the whole estate of our
present happiness and comfort in purchasing security for that, for
which no security ever was or can be given—the continued smiles of
fortune. We cannot without a presumption that will involve its own
punishment think of placing beyond the reach of chance or fate that
which by its own nature and the fluctuation of human affairs is liable
to change.</p>

<p class='c010'>But this must be the case with all distant and maritime possessions:
indeed all naval superiority is attended with this necessary disadvantage;
that, though actual power, it is not self-dependent, or the source
of its own permanence. We cannot secure the possession of the sea
in the same manner by taking ships as we can the possession of the
land by taking fortresses and countries. The longer a successful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>continental warfare is carried on, the more able is the conqueror to
carry it on: every new conquest that he makes furnishes him with
the means of making more, and secures to him what he has already
gained by striking at the heart of power, by disarming resistance, and
by very liberally rewarding the expence and trouble of keeping it—Whereas
the advantages that are gained at sea are, like that element
itself, infinitely treacherous and uncertain. We may take their ships;
but this will not hinder them from building others. We cannot build
forts or erect passes on the seas, or dig them into trenches to keep
out the enemy. We cannot enter their country and cut down their
forests; we cannot enter their ports and destroy their magazines;—all
their means and sources of power remain untouched. We cannot
prevent their exertions, though we may constantly render them
abortive. Thus, while at an enormous expence we maintain our
actual superiority, we make no advances to our object—which is
security; but are rather further from it. If we ever make peace,
which I suppose will happen sooner or later, we shall find that we
have not in any one respect lessened the means or palsied the energies
of our rivals; and while we remain at war we are teaching them two
very dangerous things, resolution and skill. I conceive no power can
be long superior to the attacks of another, unless where it has the
means of crushing its resistance in embryo. Naval dominion is in
this respect what a government would be that should give to insurgents
a free communication with each other, full liberty of forming
plans and of organizing themselves into regular bodies of troops, and
the privilege of never being attacked till they themselves gave the
signal for the onset. Military conquests are therefore in their nature
to a certain degree secure; because in maintaining them we have to
contend with those whom we have bound hand and foot, from whom
we have taken all effectual power of resistance; while in maintaining
our naval superiority, we strengthen our adversary by struggling with
him, since he has the full use of every limb and muscle, has every
inducement as well as opportunity to exert himself to the utmost, and
is in no danger of receiving any material hurt; at least this must be
the consequence where our natural strength and advantages are at
all equal. I know nothing but some such reasoning as this on the
inefficiency of naval advantages, as a means of reducing the enemy to
terms of submission, that could form the least excuse for the late
ministers in their desperate attempt to turn the course of the war
from a channel in which it was sure to be successful, into one in
which it was sure to be disastrous; to throw the game knowingly and
wilfully into the enemy’s hands, and ruin us in our allies. They
seemed to anticipate with fatal apprehension the most splendid success
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>that ever adorned the annals of the British navy, and to be determined
by an inverted ambition to match it with a pattern, in their own style,
of equal horror, discomfiture, and dismay. They seemed to conspire
maliciously with fortune, in depriving Englishmen of the pure, unalloyed
triumph of that day.—For the present, the errors of the
cabinet have entirely defeated whatever advantages we might have
derived from our naval success; and the effect of our mistaken policy
has been, that while we remain undisputed masters of the seas, and
are grasping at the commerce of the world, we see the ports of
Europe about to be shut against us. War on the continent is therefore
hopeless; war at sea useless, or worse than useless: for methinks
there is neither policy nor wisdom nor humanity ‘in resolving to set
no limits to your hostility but with your existence,’ when you have
to contend with a great and formidable foe; when you only know
that <em>he</em> is safe from your attacks; when you can only distress him,
when you gain no advantage yourself in the mean time, and cannot
possibly gain any that can be put in competition with such an alternative;
when we consider that such a resolution (however heroically
it may be formed) cannot be always persisted in (for the desire of
peace is natural, and war revolting to the human mind); that the
longer it is adhered to, the more mischievous it will become, and the
more dangerous in its consequences afterwards, and will render the
diminution of that maritime preponderance, which we have held with
such a convulsive grasp, more and more an object both of policy and
revenge to other powers.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have promised to say something of the justice of the war in its
principle, not as a war of defence but as a war of interference; though
I think the less is said on this subject the better; it can only open
‘another Iliad of woes.’ It must lead to a train of recollections that
can be of no use to us at present; or revive sentiments and a spirit
that should be recalled only (if it were possible) to be disclaimed.
The less we retain of a spirit of offence, and the sooner we forget
ourselves in the character of aggressors, in however just a cause, the
better shall we be qualified for our present posture of defence: for
there is no ground of resistance so sure as a determined belief, for the
time at least, that all aggression must be wrong. I am far from
thinking that the arbitrary conduct of a government, even where it
does not affect ourselves, is not a just ground of war, or that the conduct
of the French government was not marked by a spirit of violent
and unjust ambition. Of course if that spirit can be resisted with
effect, there is no injustice, and there is a great deal of policy in
doing it. But before we can plead generous indignation and an
uncontrolable love of justice in excuse for our rashness and imprudence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>it must be clear that pride, revenge, and the lust of dominion
have had no share in producing this ardent concern for the rights and
liberties of mankind. It is not the nature or justice of the occasion,
but the use intended to be made of it; the principles and views on
which we act, and the character of those with whom we are associated
in a common cause, that gives us a right to arrogate to ourselves the title
of assertors of the liberties of mankind. If, however, our motives
are not such as to be above all suspicion, it is not enough that we
are able to hide them from ourselves, unless we can at the same time
impose upon those who have not the same interest in being deceived
by the thin disguise that covers them. Instead then of enquiring
into the abstract justice of the war (a sort of enquiry now very nearly
exploded, and which would be of little use in guiding our practical
conclusions), let us examine in what manner our remonstrances would
be likely to be received by the government to whom they were
addressed, and how far the common feelings of humanity would
compel them ‘to bow their crested pride’ at the feet of their
accusers. Would they forget then that the undue and dangerous
influence in the affairs of Europe, which was so loudly complained
of, had been the consequence of the combined efforts of all Europe
to accomplish their destruction, and was so far from being the cause
of the hostility of other states, that it was their only security against
it? That their unjust and tyrannical encroachments on the independence
of the neighbouring states had been made in defending their own
independence from the aggressions of which they were made the
instruments? They would say, that to think of restoring the independence
of those countries would be putting into the hands of a
mortal enemy, whom you have just disarmed, the weapons with
which he may most surely effect your destruction; that whatever
advantages they had gained had been bought with their blood, shed
for their country; that if there had been any instance of unjust
aggression, or inordinate ambition, it might at least be <em>accounted for</em>
from that natural jealousy of others, and that fierce impatience of
control, that must become habitual to those who had had every kind
of difficulty to encounter, and who had triumphed over all opposition.
The gigantic strength and towering greatness of France had arisen
from her convulsive struggles for existence, and in the cause of that
liberty which was denied her. They, who had insulted her weakness
and blasted her hopes, had no right to complain of her strength or
her despair. Those who had not been able to make their country
free and happy, would be instigated by a just revenge to make her
great and formidable to her enemies. They might say, ‘You left us
no choice between the highest point of glory, and the most abject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>submission; we must either be conquerors or slaves. If you gained
an advantage, you pursued it; if you were defeated, you returned to
the charge; neither success nor misfortune inclined you to listen to
terms of accommodation: we saw that we could never hope for
peace, but either by giving to France such an ascendancy as would
overawe the rest of Europe, or by throwing ourselves at last on the
mercy of our unrelenting foe. We had not forgotten the partition of
Poland, the massacres of Ismael and Warsaw; and we could not
satisfy ourselves but that those who had had the chief concern in
these events, or had witnessed them without dismay, might have other
objects in view in entering France, besides the tranquillity of the
people, the restoration of order, or a disinterested regard for the
safety of thrones, and the independence of Europe. We could not
conceive that an implacable enmity to France was a full atonement
for all other crimes, or a security for every virtue. Pursued, hunted
down, driven to madness, we turned upon our pursuers, and trampled
them under our feet; and in the career of our fury, and the plenitude
of our triumph, you charge us with excesses, from which we ourselves
were the greatest sufferers; and with not having observed those rules
of justice and moderation, which reason required of us. We were
to have no indemnity, no security: we were to give back every conquest,
as soon as made; to fight every battle over again; to rely
solely on the faith or generosity of our adversaries, as a pledge that
no advantage would be taken of our confidence; or, if it were ten
times betrayed, we were not to complain, as we had no right to
advantages obtained by unjust violence, in a cause that exposed us
to the enmity and detestation of the human race: we were to plead
guilty to our own condemnation; to set the seal on our own infamy,
and to receive as a mark of favour and lenity, whatever implied our
admission into the common rank and privileges of mankind; and,
after endless sacrifices and exertions, we were only to prepare for new
struggles and insults, without ever hoping to end them. But from
whom were we to learn this extreme moderation, or that respect
for the rights of justice or the ties of humanity, which could be
no defence to us? Why were we not to pursue the objects of
our ambition, with the same obstinacy as those with whom we
had to contend pursued the objects of their revenge? It could
hardly be expected that all the concessions were to be made by
those who were intoxicated with the pride of victory, in favour of
those who had reaped nothing but disappointment, and who were
only urged on by a sullen despair. In this manner was the war
protracted, year after year, by open hostility, by civil dissentions,
and pretended treaties; lingered out under various pretexts, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>were artfully substituted for each other as occasion required, so as to
make it impossible ever to arrive at any decisive issue to the contest.
When defeated, the continuance of the war was necessary to their
own defence and safety; when flushed with victory for a time, then
nothing less than full indemnity for the past, as well as security for
the future would satisfy them; and then their favourite object, the
subjugation of France, and destruction of the republic, was resumed
with fresh ardour, and tempted them on till their hopes again ended
in defeat and ruin: thus adapting every aspect of affairs to their own
purposes, they constantly returned in the same circle to the point from
which they set out, and war was always necessary, peace always
unattainable. Or if at any time the fainting resolution and exhausted
strength of our adversaries seemed to promise us that repose which
was so necessary to us, we saw the dying embers of war again eagerly
rekindled by a country that, standing aloof from the contagion,
shouted from her rocky shores to see the flames that consumed the
vitals of Europe. The bitterest enmity that our early struggles in
the cause of liberty had drawn down upon us was to be shewn by a
people “that had long insulted the slavery of Europe, by the loudness
of its boasts of freedom.” English solicitation and English gold were
always ready to defeat that object, which was to be the reward of
so many triumphs, and of so many years of suffering, of havoc,
uncertainty, and dismay. A reluctant peace was at length extorted
from her: but her jealousy, avarice, and pride made her choose to
risk every thing rather than remain in a state so unnatural to her.
Delicate in her moral sentiments, disinterested in all her proceedings,
she was shocked at some violences of ours, which permitted her no
longer to remain an indifferent spectator of the calamities of other
nations, and she sought the first opportunity of evading the treaty
that had been concluded, by alarming the fears of her merchants for
the safety of their Eastern possessions. She lost no time in rousing
to her aid her former confederates in wrong. By her incantations,
the hydra-headed monster, which we thought we had finally subdued,
again feels new life and vigour restored to it, unites its severed folds,
and with its triple crown moves onward to its prey, and France must
submit or perish, that England may preserve her commerce.’ In
some such manner as this would a Frenchman repel the charges
brought against his countrymen; and, if we allow for the strength
of national prejudices, there appears to be some appearance of reason
in what he says.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> If the present quarrel had been so managed as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>have been completely disentangled from the former one, we should
have been better able to answer their reproaches, and I think to
resist their menaces. Had not Austria been precipitated unwisely
into that quarrel in the manner she was, she could not have fallen to
the ground without a struggle.</p>

<p class='c010'>In what further remarks I have to make, I shall consider whether
the system of internal policy pursued by the late minister was in its
general tendency likely to increase the spirit of independence, and
consequently the security of the country. It seems to me a desirable
object to refer as much as possible of our proceedings both at home
and abroad to the influence of that minister’s character on the national
feelings, and to the blind confidence generally placed in his talents
and integrity. The errors that we have been led into by a confidence
of this sort will be sooner retrieved than if they proceeded from a
change in our own habits and dispositions. It is well if we can save
the credit of our national character, a little at the expence of our
understandings; for I cannot think that our confidence in that
minister was well bestowed. I know it is a general maxim, that we
are not to war with the dead. We ought not, indeed, to trample
on their bodies; but with their <em>minds</em> we may and must make war,
unless we would be governed by them after they are dead. They
who wish their sentiments to survive them in the memories of men,
must also expect to live in their censures.</p>

<p class='c010'>The character of Mr. Pitt was, perhaps, one of the most singular
that ever existed. With few talents, and fewer virtues, he acquired
and preserved in one of the most trying situations, and in spite of all
opposition, the highest reputation for the possession of every moral
excellence, and as having carried the attainments of eloquence and
wisdom as far as human abilities could go. This he did (strange as
it appears) by a negation (together with the common virtues) of the
common vices of human nature, and by the complete negation of
every other talent that might interfere with the only one which he
possessed in a supreme degree, and which indeed may be made to
include the appearance of all others—an artful use of words, and a
certain dexterity of logical arrangement. In these alone his power
consisted; and the defect of all other qualities, which usually
constitute greatness, contributed to the more complete success of
these. Having no strong feelings, no distinct perceptions, his mind
having no link, as it were, to connect it with the world of external
nature, every subject presented to him nothing more than a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula
rasa</span></i>, on which he was at liberty to lay whatever colouring of language
he pleased; having no general principles, no comprehensive views of
things, no moral habits of thinking, no system of action, there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>nothing to hinder him from pursuing any particular purpose by any
means that offered; having never any plan, he could not be convicted
of inconsistency, and his own pride and obstinacy were the
only rules of his conduct. Having no insight into human nature, no
sympathy with the passions of men, or apprehension of their real
designs, he seemed perfectly insensible to the consequences of things,
and would believe nothing till it actually happened. The fog and
haze in which he saw every thing communicated itself to others, and
the total indistinctness and uncertainty of his own ideas tended to
confound the perceptions of his hearers more effectually than the
most ingenious misrepresentation could have done. Indeed, in defending
his conduct he never seemed to consider himself as at all responsible
for the success of his measures, or that future events were in our own
power; but that as the best laid schemes might fail, and there was
no providing against all possible contingencies, this was a sufficient
excuse for our plunging at once into any dangerous or absurd enterprise
without the least regard to consequences. His reserved logic
confined itself solely to the <em>possible</em> and the <em>impossible</em>, and he appeared
to regard the <em>probable</em> and <em>improbable</em>, the only foundation of moral
prudence or political wisdom, as beneath the notice of a profound
statesman; as if the pride of the human intellect were concerned in
never entrusting itself with subjects, where it may be compelled to
acknowledge its weakness.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a> From his manner of reasoning, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>seemed not to have believed that the truth of his statements depended
on the reality of the facts, but that the things depended on the order
in which he arranged them in words: you would not suppose him to
be agitating a serious question, which had real grounds to go upon,
but to be declaiming upon an imaginary thesis, proposed as an exercise
in the schools. He never set himself to examine the force of the
objections that were brought against his measures, or attempted to
establish them upon clear, solid grounds of his own; but constantly
contented himself with first gravely stating the logical form, or
dilemma to which the question reduced itself, and then, after having
declared his opinion, proceeded to amuse his hearers by a series of
rhetorical common-places, connected together in grave, sonorous, and
elaborately constructed periods, without ever shewing their real application
to the subject in dispute. Thus if any member of the
opposition disapproved of any measure, and enforced his objections by
pointing out the many evils with which it is fraught, or the difficulties
attending its execution, his only answer was, ‘that it was true there
might be inconveniences attending the measure proposed, but we were
to remember, that every expedient that could be devised might be
said to be nothing more than a choice of difficulties, and that all
that human prudence could do was to consider on which side the
advantages lay; that for his part he conceived that the present
measure was attended with more advantages and fewer disadvantages
than any other that could be adopted; that if we were diverted from
our object by every appearance of difficulty, the wheels of government
would be clogged by endless delays and imaginary grievances; that
most of the objections made to the measure appeared to him trivial,
others of them unfounded and improbable; or that if a scheme free
from all these objections could be proposed, it might after all prove
inefficient; while, in the mean time, a material object remained
unprovided for, or the opportunity of action was lost.’ This mode
of reasoning is admirably described by Hobbes, in speaking of the
writings of some of the Schoolmen, of whom he says, that ‘they had
learned the trick of imposing what they list upon their readers, and
declining the force of true reason by verbal forks, that is distinctions
which signify nothing, but serve only to astonish the multitude of
ignorant men.’ That what I have here stated comprehends the
whole force of his mind, which consisted solely in this evasive
dexterity and perplexing formality, assisted by a copiousness of words
and common-place topics, will, I think, be evident to any one who
carefully looks over his speeches, undazzled by the reputation or
personal influence of the speaker. It will be in vain to look in them
for any of the common proofs of human genius or wisdom. He has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>not left behind him a single memorable saying—not one profound
maxim—one solid observation—one forcible description—one beautiful
thought—one humourous picture—one affecting sentiment. He has
made no addition whatever to the stock of human knowledge. He
did not possess any one of those faculties which contribute to the
instruction and delight of mankind—depth of understanding, imagination,
sensibility, wit, vivacity, clear and solid judgment. But it may
be asked, If these qualities are not to be found in him, where are we
to look for them? And I may be required to point out instances of
them. I shall answer then, that he had none of the profound,
legislative wisdom, piercing sagacity, or rich, impetuous, high-wrought
imagination of Burke; the manly eloquence, strong sense, exact
knowledge, vehemence and natural simplicity of Fox; the ease,
brilliancy, and acuteness of Sheridan. It is not merely that he had
not all these qualities in the degree that they were severally possessed
by his rivals, but he had not any of them in any degree. His
reasoning is a technical arrangement of unmeaning common-places,
his eloquence merely rhetorical, his style monotonous and artificial.
If he could pretend to any one excellence in an eminent degree, it
was to taste in composition. There is certainly nothing low, nothing
puerile, nothing far-fetched or abrupt in his speeches; there is a kind
of faultless regularity pervading them throughout; but in the confined,
mechanical, passive mode of eloquence which he adopted, it seemed
rather more difficult to commit errors than to avoid them. A man
who is determined never to move out of the beaten road cannot lose
his way. However, habit, joined to the peculiar mechanical memory
which he possessed, carried his correctness to a degree which, in an
extemporaneous speaker, was almost miraculous; he perhaps hardly
ever uttered a sentence that was not perfectly regular and connected. In
this respect, he not only had the advantage over his own contemporaries,
but perhaps no one that ever lived equalled him in this singular
faculty. But for this, he would always have passed for a common
man; and to this the constant sameness, and, if I may say so,
vulgarity of his ideas must have contributed not a little, as there
was nothing to distract his mind from this one object of his unintermitted
attention; and as even in his choice of words he never
aimed at anything more than a certain general propriety and stately
uniformity of style. His talents were exactly fitted for the situation
in which he was placed; where it was his business not to overcome
others, but to avoid being overcome. He was able to baffle opposition,
not from strength or firmness, but from the evasive ambiguity and
impalpable nature of his resistance, which gave no hold to the rude
grasp of his opponents: no force could bind the loose phantom, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>his mind (though ‘not matchless, and his pride humbled by such
rebuke,’) soon rose from defeat unhurt,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And in its liquid texture mortal wound</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>By this lucky combination of strength and weakness, he succeeded
in maintaining an undiminished influence over the opinions of his own
country for a number of years, in wielding her energies as he pleased,
and guiding the counsels of almost all Europe. With respect to his
influence on the continent, that is an illusion that is past, and not
worth inquiring about; but it may still be of some use to inquire by
what means he strengthened his influence at home, as this may more
immediately concern our future conduct. This I think he effected
in two ways: by lessening the free spirit of the country as much as
he could, and by giving every possible encouragement to its commercial
spirit. I shall not here examine how far both these designs
were wise and salutary at the time; but I conceive that neither a
spirit of dependence nor an unbounded and universal spirit of trade
will be the best security for our safety at present. An indifference
to liberty is not likely to increase the love of independence; nor is
an exclusive regard to private gain likely to produce a disinterested
concern for the public welfare. Mr. Pitt, in making war, always
considered peace as an object perfectly indifferent in itself; and, in
securing the prerogative of the crown, seemed to think that the
privileges of the people did not deserve a moment’s attention. I do
not in this mean to condemn his conduct: perhaps we may suppose
that the restrictions which he introduced on the liberty of the subject,
and the spirit of passive obedience and non-resistance which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>every where industriously diffused, the contempt and obloquy which
were poured on the very name of liberty, might be required by the
circumstances of the time, and necessary to prevent the contagion of a
dangerous example, and the mischiefs of civil anarchy and confusion.
The public were perhaps justly surfeited with metaphysical treatises
overturning the foundation of all civil rights, and the very notion of
liberty, with historical disquisitions proving that the popular spirit of
political institutions was the bane of all internal quiet and happiness,
the source of endless violence and bloodshed, and the final cause of
their dissolution; that human happiness could never reach its utmost
point of perfection but under the mild and tranquil reign of universal
despotism; that the forms of all governments were alike indifferent,
provided they secured the same servile obedience and death-like
apathy in the state. Perhaps it was then necessary that we should
be told, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedrâ</span></i>, that the people had nothing to do with the laws
but to <em>obey</em> them: perhaps it was right that we should be amused with
apologies for the corrupt influence of the crown; that integrity,
honour, the love of justice, public spirit, or a zeal for the interests
of the community should be laughed at as absurd chimeras, and that
an ardent love of liberty, or determined resistance to powerful
oppression should be treated as madness and folly. But however
wise or necessary a temporary fashion of this kind might be to
counteract the poison of other views and sentiments, I am sure it
can neither be wise nor safe to continue it at present. We ought to
do every thing in our power to get rid of the effects of so dangerous
a habit as soon as possible. The fewer curbs there are on the spirit
of the people, the more vigorous and determined will it shew itself;
the greater the encouragement that is given to the principles of
liberty, and the greater confidence that is placed in the general
disposition of the country, the greater and more irresistible will be
their habitual attachment to liberty and independence. You give a
manifest advantage to an enemy if you in any way lessen the sources
of enthusiasm, or in any way check the ardour, confine the energy,
degrade the sentiments, or discountenance the erect, manly, independent
spirit of your country. It is dangerous to let any thing
fall into disrepute or contempt which may serve as a watchword to
startle the dull ear, or rouse the frozen blood; but to this purpose it
is not enough that the name is retained, if the habitual feeling is
destroyed. A tame acquiescence in every encroachment of power or
exertion of undue influence, a disposition to assert our own rights or
those of others no further than fear or interest permit, a habit of
looking on the welfare of our country or the rights of mankind as
secondary considerations, no further to be regarded than as they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>connected with our own danger or convenience, these are not the
symptoms of the durable greatness and independence of a people.
The causes of the ruin of states have been almost always laid in the
relaxation of their moral habits and political prejudices. No kingdom
can be secure in its independence against a greater power that is not
free in its spirit, as well as in its institutions. I shall be happy if I
have been mistaken in thinking these observations at all applicable to
our own country: but the observations themselves are serious, and
worth attending to. They are such as have been recognised in all
nations and ages, except those indeed where their having been so
would have rendered them suspected.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other hand, a commercial spirit is a very weak as well as
dangerous substitute for a spirit of freedom: a sense of self-interest,
of mere mercenary advantage, can but ill supply the place of principle.
The love of gain, however active or persevering this principle may
be in accomplishing its own particular ends, can never be safely
trusted to as an <em>ally</em> in a cause where there are other objects to be
attended to. Men who are actuated by this sole principle will very
obstinately, no doubt, defend their wealth, while they can retain it;
but when that is no longer the case, they will think nothing else
worth retaining, and meanly compromise their independence for
their safety. That common birthright which they receive from
nature, in which every Englishman has an equal interest as such,
appears of little value in their eyes. Liberty is in their eyes a coarse
homely figure, but for the jewels that sparkle in her hair, and the
rings on her fingers. It is inconceivable to them how a man can
have any attachment to a simple shed, or can take any pride in his
title to that respect, which is due to him only because he feels himself
to be free. They will defend England as connected with her
colonies, with her proud canopies of Eastern state, her distant spicy
groves and the rich spoils of her Western isles; but will they defend
her as she is England, as their country? Strip her of her conquests,
her slaves, and her plantations, her bales of goods, her gold
and silver, and leave her only herself, what would there be in all the
rest worth the labour of a struggle? Her barren acres, her brave,
simple, generous, honest-hearted, hardy race of men, her liberty, her
fame, her integrity they look upon with the most sovereign contempt
and indifference, and would be ready to sacrifice them all for the
purchase of some new golden settlement, ‘some happier island in the
watery waste—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Where slaves no more their native land behold,</div>
      <div class='line'>But fiends torment, and Christians thirst for gold.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>They would defend their country not as her children, but as her
masters; as a property, not as a state. There may be the same pride
and luxury in other classes of men, but they are accompanied with
other feelings, and drawn from other sources. It has been a customary
compliment to consider those as best entitled to come forward conspicuously
in defence of their country who had what is called the
greatest <em>stake</em> in it. This is perhaps true of the real, old hereditary
nobility and gentry, of those who find their names enrolled high in
the annals of their country, whose affections have grown to her soil
as it were in a long course of centuries, who have an interest in looking
forward to posterity, and a pride in looking back upon their
ancestors, who have not only present possessions and advantages to
defend, but feelings of inveterate prejudice and inbred honour to defend
them. The loss of respect, or of their former privileges, is a change
which to them appears like something out of the course of nature, to
which no force or accidental circumstances can ever reconcile them.
They are also men of liberal education; and this is a great point
gained. There is certainly this advantage in a classical education, if
not counteracted by other causes, that it gives men long views; it
accustoms the mind to take an interest in things foreign to itself, to
love virtue for its own sake, to prefer fame to life, and glory to riches,
and to fix our thoughts on the great and permanent instead of
narrow and selfish objects. It teaches us to believe that there is
something really great and excellent in the world, surviving all the
shocks of accident and fluctuations of opinion, and to feel respect for
that which is made venerable by its nature and antiquity instead of
that low and servile dread which bows only to present power and
upstart authority. It is hard to find in minds otherwise formed either
a delicate sense of honour, or an inflexible regard to truth and justice.
But the spirit of trade is the very reverse of all this. It is the
principle of this set of men to cry ‘Long life to the conqueror,’ to feel
a contempt for all obligations that are not founded in self-interest, and
to consider all generous pursuits and the hope of unfading renown as
romance and folly. ‘Virtue is not their habit, they are out of themselves
in any course of conduct recommended only by conscience and
glory.’ They would not give a hundred hogsheads of sugar or a
half-year’s income for all the posthumous fame that was ever acquired
in the world. If things should unhappily ever come to extremities,
they are not the people who will retrieve them, either by their
exertions or example. They have neither grand and elevated views,
nor the warm, genuine feelings of nature. They have no <em>principles</em> of
action. Irresolute, temporizing, every thing is with them made a
subject of selfish calculation. Their friendships as well as their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>enmities are the creatures of the occasion. Confident, insolent in the
day of success, and while their cause is triumphant, they are as soon
dejected and driven to despair, when they find the tide turned against
them. Fortune is with them the first of goddesses: success the only
title to authority and respect; and possession the truest right. Accustomed
to all the fluctuations of hope and fear, they consider nothing
stable in human affairs; thrown into the possession of power and
affluence by accidents which they know not how to account for, it can
hardly seem strange to them that they should again be stripped of
them. They do not ‘lay the fault upon themselves but on their stars,
that they are underlings.’ If I hear a man say that we are to give
up our public principles whenever circumstances render it necessary,
that we are to inquire upon all occasions not what is right, but what
is prudent to be done, that those feelings, which lead us to adhere to
the cause of truth and justice if at all unpopular, or to incur any
personal risk or inconvenience in defending what is right, are weak
and vulgar prejudices, I know that that man will be first to truckle to
an enemy, and the last voluntarily to risk his life in defence of his
independence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The courage of the soldier and the citizen are essentially different.
The one is momentary and involuntary; the other permanent and
voluntary. It is one thing to do all in your power to repel danger
when it is unavoidable, and another to expose yourself to it when you
may avoid going into it. Fear, or rashness, or necessity may be
supposed to kindle all the fury of battle: but principle alone can make
us willing to return to the charge after defeat. It is for this <em>re-action</em>
that we ought to be chiefly prepared. For this nothing can prepare
us but a true love of our country, not taken up as a fashion, but felt
as a duty; a spirit of resistance not measured by our convenience, but
by the strength of our attachment and the real value of the object;
but steady enthusiasm; but a determination never to submit while
hope or life remained, and an indifference to every thing else but that
one great object.</p>

<p class='c010'>What resistance has Holland ever made to the power of France
from the first moment? Commerce had spread its sordid mantle
completely over her. Wrapped closely up in this, she fell without
resistance and without a groan: she was not of a temper to fall in
love with danger, to court disasters. Since that time she has not
made a struggle or breathed a sigh for her release, but lies supine,
secure, unmoved, and torpid,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Dull as her lakes that slumber in the storm.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Two hundred years of commerce and riches, which had gone over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>her, since, in that noble struggle for thirty years together, she had
defied the whole power and the utmost vengeance of Spain, had prepared
her for this striking change. But England is not yet quite
commercial: the spirit of trade has not spread its poison through the
whole mass of our blood and vital juices! As I do not wish that
England (with all her high hopes, and called to a far different
destiny) may <em>ever</em> share the fate of Holland, I do not wish that she
may ever resemble her in herself; that every other feeling should
give way to that of interest alone, but that she may tremble at ever
realizing the warning picture of the poet,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——‘When, stript of all her charms,</div>
      <div class='line'>The land of scholars, and the nurse of arms,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where noble stems transmit the patriot flame,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where kings have toil’d and poets wrote for fame,</div>
      <div class='line'>One sink of level avarice shall lie,</div>
      <div class='line'>And scholars, soldiers, kings, unhonour’d die.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Though a state cannot look to its commerce for its security, it may
be involved in endless difficulty and danger by the views of commercial
aggrandizement. The views of men wholly engrossed in such pursuits
are altogether low and mechanical. If they see far, it is always in
a straight line before them; their sagacity is confined to what immediately
concerns their own interest. They are so intent upon that
one object that they overlook every thing else; and their eagerness to
accumulate is such, that they would rather hazard all than relinquish
a pursuit which promises them some new acquisition. While they are
successful, it is impossible to persuade them that they ever can be
otherwise, or to restrain their rashness by any considerations of
prudence or humanity. Actuated only by gross, palpable objects,
and full of themselves, they laugh at all distant danger. All general
reasonings on the principles of human nature, or the operation of
causes by which they do not find themselves influenced, appear to
them perfectly futile and visionary. ‘They think there is nothing real
but that which they can handle; which they can measure with a
two-foot rule, which they can tell upon ten fingers.’ As they believe
money to be the only substantial good, they are also persuaded that it
is the only instrument of power. With this they think themselves
invulnerable, and that the more of it they have, the more secure they
are. As long as their credit remains unimpaired, and their remittances
are regularly made, they consider the fate of battles and the
intrigues of cabinets as of very little comparative importance. They
look up with more awe and admiration to a stock-jobbing broker
surrounded with his clerks than they do to a victorious general at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>head of his army. The rise and fall of stocks, and the demand for
our manufactures abroad, are in their opinion the only criterions of
national prosperity. On the other hand, whatever affects their own
interest, the loss of an island, or the stopping up of a port, is found
immediately to threaten the ruin of the country. Their fears are as
rash and groundless as their confidence. Every thing in which they
themselves are concerned is viewed through a magnifying medium,
and demands all our vigilance and attention, while every thing else
dwindles into insignificance. I therefore think there ought to be as
little connection as possible between the measures of government and
the maxims of the Exchange, and that the interests of a great empire
ought not to be managed by a company of factors.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have thus expressed the sentiments which occurred to me on the
present situation of our affairs, and some of the steps which led to it.
I have done this as freely and unreservedly as I could, because if they
are wrong, it is not likely that they will be much attended to; but if
they are right, they may be of some use. And I conceive that even
they who may think the view I have taken of the measures of the
last administration, and the application of particular observations to
our own conduct altogether unfounded, will not deny the truth of the
general principles on which they are built. Or that the sentiments of
justice, of honour, of reason and liberty, by which I think our views
and conduct <em>ought</em> to have been regulated, can be too deeply impressed
on our minds.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>PREFACE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I am no politician, and still less can I be said to be a party-man: but
I have a hatred of tyranny, and a contempt for its tools; and this
feeling I have expressed as often and as strongly as I could. I
cannot sit quietly down under the claims of barefaced power, and I
have tried to expose the little arts of sophistry by which they are
defended. I have no mind to have my person made a property of,
nor my understanding made a dupe of. I deny that liberty and
slavery are convertible terms, that right and wrong, truth and falsehood,
plenty and famine, the comforts or wretchedness of a people,
are matters of perfect indifference. That is all I know of the
matter; but on these points I am likely to remain incorrigible, in
spite of any arguments that I have seen used to the contrary. It
needs no sagacity to discover that two and two make four; but to
persist in maintaining this obvious position, if all the fashion, authority,
hypocrisy, and venality of mankind were arrayed against it, would
require a considerable effort of personal courage, and would soon
leave a man in a very formidable minority. Again, I am no believer
in the doctrine of <em>divine right</em>, either as it regards the Stuarts or the
Bourbons; nor can I bring myself to approve of the enormous waste
of blood and treasure wilfully incurred by a family that supplanted
the one in this country to restore the others in France. It is to my
mind a piece of sheer impudence. The question between natural
liberty and hereditary slavery, whether men are born free or slaves,
whether kings are the servants of the people, or the people the
property of kings (whatever we may think of it in the abstract, or
debate about it in the schools)—in this country, in Old England,
and under the succession of the House of Hanover, is not a
question of theory, but has been long since decided by certain facts
and feelings, to call which in question would be equally inconsistent
with proper respect to the people, or common decency towards the
throne. An English subject cannot call this principle in question
without renouncing his country; an English prince cannot call it in
question without disclaiming his title to the crown, which was placed
by our ancestors on the head of his ancestors, on no other ground
and for no other possible purpose than to vindicate this sacred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>principle in their own persons, and to hold it out as an example to
posterity and to the world. An Elector of Hanover, called over
here to be made king of England, in contempt and to the exclusion
of the claims of the old, hereditary possessors and pretenders to the
throne, on any other plea except that of his being the chosen representative
and appointed guardian of the rights and liberties of the
people (the consequent pledge and guarantee of the rights and
liberties of other nations) would indeed be a solecism more absurd
and contemptible than any to be found in history. What! Send for
a petty Elector of a petty foreign state to reign over us from respect
to <em>his</em> right to the throne of these realms, in defiance of the legitimate
heir to the crown, and ‘in contempt of the choice of the people!’
Oh monstrous fiction! Miss Flora Mac Ivor would not have heard
of such a thing: the author of Waverley has well answered
Mr. Burke’s ‘Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs.’<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Let not
our respect for our ancestors, who fought and bled for their own
freedom, and to aid (not to stifle) the cause of freedom in other
nations, suffer us to believe this poor ideot calumny of them. Let
not our shame at having been inveigled into crusades and Holy
Alliances against the freedom of mankind, suffer us to be made the
dupes of it ourselves, in thought, in word, or deed. The question of
genuine liberty or of naked slavery, if put in words, should be
answered by Englishmen with scorn: if put in any other shape than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>words, it must be answered in a different way, unless they would lose
the name of Englishmen! An Englishman has no distinguishing
virtue but honesty: he has and can have no privilege or advantage
over other nations but liberty. If he is not free, he is the worst of
slaves, for he is nothing else. If he feels that he has wrongs and
dare not say so, he is the meanest of hypocrites; for it is certain that
he cannot be contented under them.—This was once a free, a proud,
and happy country, when under a constitutional monarchy and a
Whig king, it had just broken the chains of tyranny that were
prepared for it, and successfully set at defiance the menaces of an
hereditary pretender; when the monarch still felt what he owed to
himself and the people, and in the opposite claims which were set up
to it, saw the real tenure on which he held his crown; when civil
and religious liberty were the watch-words by which good men and
true subjects were known to one another, not by the cant of legitimacy;
when the reigning sovereign stood between you and the polluted touch
of a bigot and a despot who stood ready to seize upon you and yours
as his lawful prey; when liberty and loyalty went hand in hand, and
the Tory principles of passive obedience and non-resistance were more
unfashionable at court than in the country; when to uphold the
authority of the throne, it was not thought necessary to undermine
the privileges or break the spirit of the nation; when an Englishman
felt that his name was another name for independence, ‘the envy of
less happier lands,’ when it was his pride to be born, and his wish
that other nations might become free; before a sophist and an
apostate had dared to tell him that he had no share, no merit, no free
agency, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, and that he was bound to
lend a helping hand to crush all others, that implied a right in the
people to chuse their own form of government; before he was
become sworn brother to the Pope, familiar to the Holy Inquisition,
an encourager of the massacres of his Protestant brethren, a patron of
the Bourbons, and jailor to the liberties of mankind! Ah, John
Bull! John Bull! thou art not what thou wert in the days of thy
friend, Arbuthnot! Thou wert an honest fellow then: now thou art
turned bully and coward.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is the only politics I know; the only patriotism I feel. The
question with me is, whether I and all mankind are born slaves or
free. That is the one thing necessary to know and to make good:
the rest is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">flocci, nauci, nihili, pili</span></i>. Secure this point, and all is safe:
lose this, and all is lost. There are people who cannot understand a
principle; nor perceive how a cause can be connected with an
individual, even in spite of himself, nor how the salvation of mankind
can be bound up with the success of one man. It is in vain that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>address to them what follows.—‘One fate attends the altar and the
throne.’ So sings Mr. Southey. I say, that one fate attends the
people and the assertor of the people’s rights against those who say
they have no rights, that they are their property, their goods, their
chattels, the live-stock on the estate of Legitimacy. This is what
kings at present tell us with their swords, and poets with their pens.
He who tells me this deprives me not only of the right, but of the
very heart and will to be free, takes the breath out of the body of
liberty, and leaves it a dead and helpless corse, destroys ‘at one fell
swoop’ the dearest hopes, and blasts the fairest prospects of mankind
through all ages and nations, sanctifies slavery, binds it as a spell on
the understanding, and makes freedom a mockery, and the name a
bye-word. The poor wretch immured in the dungeons of the
Inquisition may breathe a sigh to liberty, may repeat its name, may
think of it as a blessing, if not to himself, to others; but the wretch
imprisoned in the dungeon of Legitimacy, the very tomb of freedom,
that ‘painted sepulchre, white without, but full of ravening and all
uncleanness within,’ must not even think of it, must not so much as
dream of it, but as a thing forbid: it is a profanation to his lips, an
impiety to his thoughts; his very imagination is enthralled, and he
can only look forward to the never-ending flight of future years, and
see the same gloomy prospect of abject wretchedness and hopeless
desolation spread out for himself and his species. They who bow to
thrones and hate mankind may here feast their eyes with blight,
mildew, the blue pestilence and glittering poison of slavery, ‘bogs,
dens, and shades of death—a universe of death.’ This is that true
moral atheism, the equal blasphemy against God and man, the
sin against the Holy Ghost, that lowest deep of debasement and
despair to which there is no lower deep. He who saves me from
this conclusion, who makes a mock of this doctrine, and sets at
nought its power, is to me not less than the God of my idolatry, for
he has left one drop of comfort in my soul. The plague-spot has
not tainted me quite; I am not leprous all over, the lie of Legitimacy
does not fix its mortal sting in my inmost soul, nor, like an ugly
spider, entangle me in its slimy folds; but is kept off from me, and
broods on its own poison. He who did this for me, and for the rest
of the world, and who alone could do it, was Buonaparte. He
withstood the inroads of this new Jaggernaut, this foul Blatant Beast,
as it strode forward to its prey over the bodies and minds of a whole
people, and put a ring in its nostrils, breathing flame and blood, and
led it in triumph, and played with its crowns and sceptres, and wore
them in its stead, and tamed its crested pride, and made it a laughing-stock
and a mockery to the nations. He, one man, did this, and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>long as he did this, (how, or for what end, is nothing to the
magnitude of this mighty question) he saved the human race from the
last ignominy, and that foul stain that had so long been intended, and
was at last, in an evil hour and by evil hands, inflicted on it. He
put his foot upon the neck of kings, who would have put their yoke
upon the necks of the people: he scattered before him with fiery
execution, millions of hired slaves, who came at the bidding of their
masters to deny the right of others to be free. The monument of
greatness and of glory he erected, was raised on ground forfeited
again and again to humanity—it reared its majestic front on the ruins
of the shattered hopes and broken faith of the common enemies of
mankind. If he could not secure the freedom, peace, and happiness
of his country, he made her a terror to those who by sowing civil
dissension and exciting foreign wars, would not let her enjoy those
blessings. They who had trampled upon Liberty could not at least
triumph in her shame and her despair, but themselves became objects
of pity and derision. Their determination to persist in extremity of
wrong only brought on themselves repeated defeat, disaster, and
dismay: the accumulated aggressions their infuriated pride and
disappointed malice meditated against others, returned in just and
aggravated punishment upon themselves: they heaped coals of fire
upon their own heads; they drank deep and long, in gall and bitterness,
of the poisoned chalice they had prepared for others: the
destruction with which they had threatened a people daring to call
itself free, hung suspended over their heads, like a precipice, ready to
fall upon and crush them. ‘Awhile they stood abashed,’ abstracted
from their evil purposes, and felt how awful freedom is, its power
how dreadful. Shrunk from the boasted pomp of royal state into
their littleness as men, defeated of their revenge, baulked of their
prey, their schemes stripped of their bloated pride, and with nothing
left but the deformity of their malice, not daring to utter a syllable or
move a finger, the lords of the earth, who had looked upon men as
of an inferior species, born for their use, and devoted to be their
slaves, turned an imploring eye to the people, and with coward
hearts and hollow tongues invoked the name of Liberty, thus to get
the people once more within their unhallowed gripe, and to stifle the
name of Liberty for ever. I never joined the vile and treacherous
cry of spurious humanity in favour of those who have from the
beginning of time, and will to the end of it, make a butt of humanity,
and its distresses their sport. I knew that shameful was this new
alliance between kings and people; fatal this pretended league: that
‘never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate
have pierced so deep.’ I was right in this respect. I knew my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>friends from my foes. So did Lord Castlereagh: so did not
Benjamin Constant. Did any of the Princes of Europe ever regard
Buonaparte as any thing more than the child and champion of
Jacobinism? Why then should I: for on that point I bow to their
judgments as infallible. Passion speaks truer than reason. If
Buonaparte was a conqueror, he conquered the grand conspiracy of
kings against the abstract right of the human race to be free; and I,
as a man, could not be indifferent which side to take. If he was
ambitious, his greatness was not founded on the unconditional, avowed
surrender of the rights of human nature. But with him, the state of
man rose exalted too. If he was arbitrary and a tyrant, first, France
as a country was in a state of military blockade, on garrison-duty, and
not to be defended by mere paper bullets of the brain; secondly, but
chief, he was not, nor he could not become, a tyrant by right divine.
Tyranny in him was not sacred: it was not eternal: it was not
instinctively bound in league of amity with other tyrannies; it was
not sanctioned by all the laws of religion and morality. There was
an end of it with the individual: there was an end of it with the
temporary causes, which gave it birth, and of which it was only the
too necessary re-action. But there are persons of that low and inordinate
appetite for servility, that they cannot be satisfied with any thing
short of that sort of tyranny that has lasted for ever, and is likely to
last for ever; that is strengthened and made desperate by the
superstitions and prejudices of ages; that is enshrined in traditions,
in laws, in usages, in the outward symbols of power, in the very
idioms of language; that has struck its roots into the human heart,
and clung round the human understanding like a nightshade; that
overawes the imagination, and disarms the will to resist it, by the very
enormity of the evil; that is cemented with gold and blood; guarded
by reverence, guarded by power; linked in endless succession to the
principle by which life is transmitted to the generations of tyrants and
slaves, and destroying liberty with the first breath of life; that is
absolute, unceasing, unerring, fatal, unutterable, abominable, monstrous.
These true devotees of superstition and despotism cried out Liberty
and Humanity in their desperate phrenzy at Buonaparte’s sudden
elevation and incredible successes against their favourite idol, ‘that
Harlot old, the same that is, that was, and is to be,’ but we have
heard no more of their triumph of Liberty and their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douce humanité</span></i>,
since they clapped down the hatches upon us again, like wretches in
a slave-ship who have had their chains struck off and pardon promised
them to fight the common enemy; and the poor Reformers who were
taken in to join the cry, because they are as fastidious in their love of
liberty as their opponents are inveterate in their devotion to despotism,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>continue in vain to reproach them with their temporary professions,
woeful grimaces, and vows made in pain, which ease has recanted;
but to these reproaches the legitimate professors of Liberty and
Humanity do not even deign to return the answer of a smile at their
credulity and folly. Those who did not see this result at the time
were, I think, weak; those who do not acknowledge it now are, I
am sure, hypocrites.—To this pass have we been brought by the joint
endeavours of Tories, Whigs, and Reformers; and as they have all
had a hand in it, I shall here endeavour to ascribe to each their share
of merit in this goodly piece of work. It is, perhaps, a delicate
point, but it is of no inconsiderable importance, that the friends of
Freedom should know the strength of their enemies, and their own
weakness as well; for</p>

<p class='c010'>A Reformer is not a gregarious animal. Speculative opinion leads
men different ways, each according to his particular fancy:—it is
prejudice or interest that drives before it the herd of mankind. That
<em>which is</em>, with all its confirmed abuses and ‘tickling commodities,’ is
alone solid and certain: that <em>which may be</em> or <em>ought to be</em>, has a
thousand shapes and colours, according to the eye that sees it, is
infinitely variable and evanescent in its effects. Talk of mobs as we
will, the only true mob is that incorrigible mass of knaves and fools
in every country, who never think at all, and who never feel for any
one but themselves. I call any assembly of people a mob (be it the
House of Lords or House of Commons) where each person’s opinion
on any question is governed by what others say of it, and by what he
can get by it. The only instance of successful resistance in the
House of Commons to Ministers for many years was in the case of
the Income-Tax; which touched their own pockets nearly. This
was ‘a feeling disputation,’ in which selfishness got the better of
servility, while reason and humanity might have pleaded in vain.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>The exception proved the rule; and this evidence was alone wanting
to establish their character for independence and disinterestedness.
When some years ago Mr. Robson brought forward in the House
the case of an Exchequer Bill for 3<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> 16<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> which had been refused
payment at the Bank, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Mr.
Addington, now Lord Sidmouth) rose, and in a tone of indignation,
severely reprimanded Mr. Robson for having prematurely brought
forward a fact which he knew to be impossible; and the House
cheered the Minister, and scouted Mr. Robson and his motion for
inquiry. The next day, Mr. Robson repeated his charge, and Mr.
Addington rose, and in the same tone of official authority, brow-beat
Mr. Robson for having brought forward, as something reprehensible
and extraordinary, what he said happened every day, though the day
before he had undertaken of his own accord to pronounce it impossible;
and the House cheered the Minister, and scouted Mr. Robson
and his motion for inquiry. What was it to them whether Mr.
Robson was right or wrong? It was their cue (I speak this of the
House of Commons of 1803) to support the Minister, whether right
or wrong! Every corporate body, or casual concourse of people, is
nothing more than a collection of prejudices, and the only arguments
current with them, a collection of watch-words. You may
ring the changes for ever on the terms Bribery and Corruption
with the people in Palace-yard, as they do in the Room over the
way on Religion, Loyalty, Public Credit, and Social Order.
There is no difference whatever in this respect between the Great
Vulgar and the Small, who are managed just in the same way by
their different leaders. To procure unanimity, to get men to act
in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps</span></i>, we must appeal for the most part to gross and obvious
motives, to authority and passion, to their vices, not their virtues:
we must discard plain truth and abstract justice as doubtful and
inefficient pleas, retaining only the names and the pretext as a
convenient salvo for hypocrisy! He is the best leader of a party
who can find out the greatest number of common-places faced with
the public good; and he will be the stoutest partisan who can best
turn the lining to account.—Tory sticks to Tory: Whig sticks to
Whig: the Reformer sticks neither to himself nor to any body else.
It is no wonder he comes to the ground with all his schemes and
castle-building. A house divided against itself cannot stand. It is
a pity, but it cannot be helped. A Reformer is necessarily and
naturally a Marplot, for the foregoing and the following reasons.
First, he does not very well know what he would be at. Secondly,
if he did, he does not care very much about it. Thirdly, he is
governed habitually by a spirit of contradiction, and is always wise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>beyond what is practicable. He is a bad tool to work with; a part
of a machine that never fits its place; he cannot be trained to
discipline, for he follows his own idle humours, or drilled into an
obedience to orders, for the first principle of his mind is the
supremacy of conscience, and the independent right of private
judgment. A man to be a Reformer must be more influenced by
imagination and reason than by received opinions or sensible impressions.
With him ideas bear sway over things; the possible is
of more value than the real; that which is not, is better than that
which is. He is by the supposition a speculative (and somewhat
fantastical) character; but there is no end of possible speculations,
of imaginary questions, and nice distinctions; or if there were, he
would not willingly come to it; he would still prefer living in the
world of his own ideas, be for raising some new objection, and
starting some new chimera, and never be satisfied with any plan that
he found he could realise. Bring him to a fixed point, and his
occupation would be gone. A Reformer never is—but always to be
blest, in the accomplishment of his airy hopes and shifting schemes
of progressive perfectibility. Let him have the plaything of his
fancy, and he will spoil it, like the child that makes a hole in its
drum: set some brilliant illusion before his streaming eyes, and he
will lay violent hands upon it, like little wanton boys that play with
air-bubbles. Give him one thing, and he asks for another; like the
dog in the fable, he loses the substance for the shadow: offer him a
great good, and he will not stretch out his hand to take it, unless it
were the greatest possible good. And then who is to determine
what is the greatest possible good? Among a thousand pragmatical
speculators, there will be a thousand opinions on this subject; and
the more they differ, the less will they be inclined to give way or
compromise the matter. With each of these, his self-opinion is the
first thing to be attended to; his understanding must be satisfied in
the first place, or he will not budge an inch; he cannot for the
world give up a principle to a party. He would rather have slavery
than liberty, unless it is a liberty precisely after his own fashion: he
would sooner have the Bourbons than Buonaparte; for he truly is
for a Republic, and if he cannot have that, is indifferent about the
rest. So (to compare great things with small) Mr. Place, of
Charing-Cross, chose rather that Mr. Hobhouse should lose his
Election than that it should not be accompanied with his Resolutions;
so he published his Resolutions, and lost Mr. Hobhouse his Election.
That is, a patriot of this stamp is really indifferent about every thing
but what he cannot have; instead of making his option between two
things, a good or an evil, within his reach, our exquisite Sir sets up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>a third thing as the object of his choice, with some impossible
condition annexed to it,—to dream, to talk, to write, to be meddlesome
and troublesome about, to serve him for a topic of captious
discontent or vague declamation, and which if he saw any hopes of
cordial agreement or practical co-operation to carry it into effect, he
would instantly contrive to mar, and split it into a thousand fractions,
doubts, and scruples, to make it an impossibility for any thing ever to
be done for the good of mankind, which is merely the plaything of
his theoretical imbecility and active impertinence! The Goddess
of his idolatry is and will always remain a cloud, instead of a Juno.
One of these virtuosos, these Nicolas Gimcracks of Reform, full of
intolerable and vain conceit, sits smiling in the baby-house of his
imagination, ‘pleased with a feather, tickled with a straw,’ trimming
the balance of power in the looking-glass of his own self-complacency,
having every thing his own way at a word’s speaking, making the
‘giant-mass’ of things only a reflection of his personal pretensions,
approving every thing that is right, condemning every thing that is
wrong, in compliment to his own character, considering how what
he says will affect not the cause, but himself; keeping himself aloof
from party-spirit, and from every thing that can cast a shade on the
fancied delicacy of his own breast, and thus letting the cause of
Liberty slip through his fingers, and be spilt like water on the
ground:—while another, more bold than he, in a spirit of envy and
ignorance, quarrels with all those who are labouring at the same oar,
lays about him like mad, runs a-muck at every one who has done, or
is likely to do, any thing to promote the common object, and with
his desperate club dashes out his neighbour’s brains, and thinks he
has done a good piece of service to the cause, because he has glutted
his own ill-humour and self-will, which he mistakes for the love of
liberty and a zeal for truth! Others, not able to do mischief enough
singly, club their senseless contradictions and unmanageable humours
together, turn their attention to cabal and chicane, get into committees,
make speeches, move or second resolutions, dictate to their followers,
set up for the heads of a party, in opposition to another party; abuse,
vilify, expose, betray, counteract and undermine each other in every
way, and throw the game into the hands of the common enemy, who
laughs in his sleeve, and watches them and their little perverse,
pettifogging passions at work for him, from the high tower of his
pride and strength! If an honest and able man arises among them,
they grow jealous of him, and would rather, in the petty ostracism of
their minds, that their cause should fail, than that another should have
the credit of bringing it to a triumphant conclusion. They criticise
his conduct, carp at his talents, denounce his friends, suspect his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>motives, and do not rest, till by completely disgusting him with the
name of Reform and Reformers, they have made him what they wish,
a traitor and deserter from a cause that no man can serve! This
is just what they like—they satisfy their malice, they have to find
out a new leader, and the cause is to begin again! So it was, and
so it will be, while man remains the little, busy, mischievous animal
described in Gulliver’s Travels!—A pretty hopeful set to make head
against their opponents—a rope of sand against a rock of marble—with
no centre of gravity, but a collection of atoms whirled about in
empty space by their own levity, or jostling together by numberless
points of repulsion, and tossed with all their officious projects and
airy predictions, by the first breath of caprice or shock of power, into
that Limbo of Vanity, where embryo statesmen and drivelling
legislators dance the hays of Reform, ‘perpetual circle, multiform and
mix, and hinder all things,’ proud of the exclusive purity of their
own motives, and the unattainable perfection of their own plans!—How
different from the self-centred, well-knit, inseparable phalanx
of power and authority opposed to their impotent and abortive
designs! A Tory is one who is governed by sense and habit alone.
He considers not what is possible, but what is real; he gives might
the preference over right. He cries Long Life to the conqueror,
and is ever strong upon the stronger side—the side of corruption and
prerogative. He says what others say; he does as he is prompted
by his own advantage. He knows on which side his bread is
buttered, and that St. Peter is well at Rome. He is for going with
Sancho to Camacho’s wedding, and not for wandering with Don
Quixote in the desert, after the mad lover. Strait is the gate and
narrow is the way that leadeth to Reform, but broad is the way
that leadeth to Corruption, and multitudes there are that walk
therein. The Tory is sure to be in the thickest of them. His
principle is to follow the leader; and this is the infallible rule to
have numbers and success on your side, to be on the side of success
and numbers. Power is the rock of his salvation; priestcraft is the
second article of his implicit creed. He does not trouble himself to
inquire which is the best form of government—but he knows that the
reigning monarch is ‘the best of kings.’ He does not, like a fool,
contest for modes of faith; but like a wise man, swears by that
which is by law established. He has no principles himself, nor does
he profess to have any, but will cut your throat for differing with
any of his bigotted dogmas, or for objecting to any act of power
that he supposes necessary to his interest. He will take his Bible-oath
that black is white, and that whatever is, is right, if it is for
his convenience. He is for having a slice in the loan, a share in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>borough, a situation in the church or state, or for standing well with
those who have. He is not for empty speculations, but for full
pockets. He is for having plenty of beef and pudding, a good
coat to his back, a good house over his head, and for cutting a
respectable figure in the world. He is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epicuri de grege porcus</span></i>—not
a man but a beast. He is styed in his prejudices—he wallows in the
mire of his senses—he cannot get beyond the trough of his sordid
appetites, whether it is of gold or wood. Truth and falsehood are,
to him, something to buy and sell; principle and conscience, something
to eat and drink. He tramples on the plea of Humanity, and
lives, like a caterpillar, on the decay of public good. Beast as he is,
he knows that the King is the fountain of honour, that there are good
things to be had in the Church, treats the cloth with respect, bows
to a magistrate, lies to the tax-gatherer, nicknames the Reformers,
and ‘blesses the Regent and the Duke of York.’ He treads the
primrose path of preferment; ‘when a great wheel goes up a hill,
holds fast by it, and when it rolls down, lets it go.’ He is not an
enthusiast, a Utopian philosopher or a Theophilanthropist, but a man
of business and the world, who minds the main chance, does as other
people do, and takes his wife’s advice to get on in the world, and
set up a coach for her to ride in, as fast as possible. This fellow is
in the right, and ‘wiser in his generation than the children of the
light.’ The ‘servile slaves’ of wealth and power have a considerable
advantage over the independent and the free. How much
easier is it to smell out a job than to hit upon a scheme for the good
of mankind! How much safer is it to be the tool of the oppressor
than the advocate of the oppressed! How much more fashionable to
fall in with the opinion of the world, to bow the knee to Baal, than
to seek for obscure and obnoxious truth! How strong are the ties
that bind men together for their own advantage, compared with those
that bind them to the good of their country or of their kind! For
as the Reformer has no guide to his conclusions but speculative
reason, which is a source not of unanimity or certainty, but of endless
doubt and disagreement, so he has no ground of attachment to them
but a speculative interest, which is too often liable to be warped by
sinister motives, and is a flimsy barrier against the whole weight of
worldly and practical interests opposed to it. He either tires and
grows lukewarm after the first gloss of novelty is over, and is thrown
into the hands of the adverse party, or to keep alive an interest in it,
he makes it the stalking-horse of his ambition, of his personal enmity,
of his conceit or love of gossipping; as we have seen. An opinion
backed by power and prejudice, rivetted and mortised to the throne,
is of more force and validity than all the abstract reason in the world,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>without power and prejudice. A cause centred in an individual,
which is strengthened by all the ties of passion and self-interest, as
in the case of a king against a whole people, is more likely to prevail
than that of a scattered multitude, who have only a common and
divided interest to hold them together, and ‘screw their courage to
the sticking-place,’ against an influence, that is never distracted or
dissipated; that neither slumbers nor sleeps; that is never lulled into
security, nor tamed by adversity; that is intoxicated with the insolence
of success, and infuriated with the rage of disappointment;
that eyes its one sole object of personal aggrandisement, moves unremittingly
to it, and carries after it millions of its slaves and train-bearers.
Can you persuade a king to hear reason, to submit his
pretensions to the tribunal of the people, to give up the most absurd
and mischievous of his prerogatives? No: he is always true to himself,
he grasps at power and hugs it close, as it is exorbitant or invidious,
or likely to be torn from him; and his followers stick to him, and
never boggle at any lengths they are forced to go, because they know
what they have to trust to in the good faith of kings to themselves
and one another. Power then is fixed and immoveable, for this
reason, because it is lodged in an individual who is driven to madness
by the undisputed possession, or apprehended loss of it; his self-will
is the key-stone that supports the tottering arch of corruption, steadfast
as it leans on him:—liberty is vacillating, transient, and hunted
through the world, because it is entrusted to the breasts of many, who
care little about it, and quarrel in the execution of their trust. Too
many cooks spoil the broth. The principle of tyranny is in fact
identified with a man’s pride and the servility of others in the highest
degree; the principle of liberty abstracts him from himself, and has
to contend in its feeble course with all his own passions, prejudices,
interests, and those of the world and of his own party; the cavils of
Reformers, the threats of Tories, and the sneers of Whigs.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>A modern Whig is but the fag-end of a Tory. The old Whigs
were in principle what the modern Jacobins are, Anti-Jacobites, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>is, opposers of the doctrine of divine right, the one in the soil of
England, the other by parity of reasoning in the soil of France.
But the Opposition have pressed so long against the Ministry without
effect, that being the softer substance, and made of more yielding
materials, they have been moulded into their image and superscription,
spelt backwards, or they differ as concave and convex, or they go
together like substantive and adjective, or like man and wife, they two
have become one flesh. A Tory is the indispensable prop to the
doubtful sense of self-importance, and peevish irritability of negative
success, which mark the life of a Whig leader or underling. They
‘are subdued even to the very quality’ of the Lords of the Treasury
Bench, and have quarrelled so long that they would be quite at a loss
without the ordinary food of political contention. To interfere
between them is as dangerous as to interfere in a matrimonial squabble.
To overturn the one is to trip up the heels of the other. Their
hostility is not directed against things at all, nor to effectual and
decisive opposition to men, but to that sort of petty warfare and
parliamentary <em>tracasserie</em>, of which there is neither end nor use,
except making the parties concerned of consequence in their own
eyes, and contemptible in those of the nation. They will not allow
Ministers to be severely handled by any one but themselves, nor even
that: but they say civil things of them in the House of Commons,
and whisper scandal against them at Holland House. This shews
gentlemanly refinement and good breeding; while my Lord Erskine
‘calls us untaught knaves, unmannerly to come betwixt the wind and
his nobility.’ But the leaden bullets and steel bayonets, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultima
ratio regum</span></i>, by which these questions are practically decided, do their
business in another-guess manner; they do not stand on the same
ceremony. Soft words and hard blows are a losing game to play at:
and this, one would think, the Opposition, if they were sincere, must
have found out long ago. But they rather wish to screen the Ministry,
as their <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">locum tenens</span></i> in the receipt of the perquisites of office and the
abuse of power, of which they themselves expect the reversion.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The distinction between a great Whig and Tory Lord is laughable.
For Whigs to Tories ‘nearly are allied, and thin partitions do their
bounds divide.’ So I cannot find out the different drift (as far as
politics are concerned) of the ********* and ********* Reviews,
which remind one of Opposition coaches, that raise a great dust or
spatter one another with mud, but both travel the same road and arrive
at the same destination. When the Editor of a respectable Morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Paper reproached me with having called Mr. Gifford a cat’s-paw, I
did not tell him that he was a glove upon that cat’s-paw. I might
have done so. There is a difference between a sword and a foil.
The Whigs do not at all relish that ugly thing, a knock-down blow;
which is so different from their endless see-saw way of going about a
question. They are alarmed, ‘lest the courtiers offended should be:’
for they are so afraid of their adversaries, that they dread the re-action
even of successful opposition to them, and will neither attempt it
themselves, nor stand by any one that does. Any writer who is not
agreeable to the Tories, becomes obnoxious to the Whigs; he is
disclaimed by them as a dangerous colleague, merely for having ‘done
the cause some service;’ is considered as having the malicious design
to make a breach of the peace, and to interrupt with most admired
disorder the harmony and mutual good understanding which subsists
between Ministers and the Opposition, and on the adherence to
which they are alone suffered to exist, or to have a shadow of
importance in the state. They are, in fact, a convenient medium to
break the force of popular feeling, and to transmit the rays of popular
indignation against the influence and power of the crown, blunted and
neutralized by as many qualifications and refractions as possible. A
Whig is properly what is called a Trimmer—that is, a coward to
both sides of a question, who dare not be a knave nor an honest
man, but is a sort of whiffling, shuffling, cunning, silly, contemptible,
unmeaning negation of the two. He is a poor purblind creature, who
halts between two opinions, and complains that he cannot get any two
people to think alike. He is a cloak for corruption, and a mar-plot
to freedom. He will neither do any thing himself, nor let any one
else do it. He is on bad terms with the Government, and not on
good ones with the people. He is an impertinence and a contradiction
in the state. If he has a casting weight, for fear of overdoing the
mark, he throws it into the wrong scale. He is a person of equally
feeble understanding and passions. He has some notion of what is
right, just enough to hinder him from pursuing his own interest: he
has selfish and worldly prudence enough, not to let him embark in any
bold or decided measure for the advancement of truth and justice.
He is afraid of his own conscience, which will not let him lend his
unqualified support to arbitrary measures; he stands in awe of the
opinion of the world, which will not let him express his opposition to
those measures with warmth and effect. His politics are a strange
mixture of cross-purposes. He is wedded to forms and appearances,
impeded by every petty obstacle and pretext of difficulty, more
tenacious of the means than the end—anxious to secure all suffrages,
by which he secures none—hampered not only by the ties of friendship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>to his actual associates, but to all those that he thinks may
become so; and unwilling to offer arguments to convince the reason
of his opponents lest he should offend their prejudices, by shewing
them how much they are in the wrong; ‘letting I dare not wait upon
I would, like the poor cat in the adage;’ stickling for the letter of
the Constitution, with the affectation of a prude, and abandoning its
principles with the effrontery of a prostitute to any shabby Coalition
he can patch up with its deadly enemies. This is very pitiful work;
and, I believe, the public with me are tolerably sick of the character.
At the same time, he hurls up his cap with a foolish face of wonder
and incredulity at the restoration of the Bourbons, and affects to
chuckle with secret satisfaction over the last act of the Revolution,
which reduced him to perfect insignificance. We need not wonder at
the results, when it comes to the push between parties so differently
constituted and unequally matched. We have seen what those results
are. I cannot do justice to the picture, but I find it done to my
hands in those prophetic lines of Pope, where he describes the last
Triumph of Corruption:—</p>

produce a degree of dull vivacity, of pointed insignificance, and
impotent energy, which is without any parallel but itself. It is
curious, though somewhat painful, to see this lively little lord always
in the full career of his subject, and never advancing a jot the nearer;
seeming to utter volumes in every word, and yet saying nothing;
retaining the same unabated vehemence of voice and action without

<p class='c013'>The laurel is at length destined, unexpectedly, to circle the brows
of this gentleman, where it will look almost like a civic crown. The
patriot and the poet (two venerable names, which we should wish
never to see disunited) is said to owe his intended elevation to the
intercession of Mr. Croker, to whom, it will be recollected, he has
dedicated his Life of Lord Nelson, with an appropriate motto in the
title-page, from the poem of Ulm and Trafalgar. Mr. Croker having
applied to the Regent in favour of his friend, the Prince is understood
to have given his ready assent, observing, that Mr. Southey’s
efforts in the Spanish cause alone, rendered him highly worthy of the
situation. As Mr. Croker, however, was taking his leave, he was
met by Lord Liverpool and the Marquis of Hertford, the latter of
whom, as chamberlain, had, it seems, made an offer of the place to
Mr. Walter Scott, who had signified his acceptance of it. Some
little difficulty naturally arose on the occasion, but it was agreed that
the two poets should settle the point of precedence between themselves.
A friendly altercation, unlike that of the shepherds in Virgil,
now took place between Mr. Scott and Mr. Southey, each waving
his own pretensions, and giving the palm of victory to the other.
But it was finally determined, that as Mr. Scott, though he would
not allow himself to be the greatest, was at least the richest poet of
the two, Mr. Southey, who had most need of this post of honour and
of profit, should have it. So ends this important affair; and, without
any ill-will to Mr. Southey, we should not have been disappointed if
it had ended differently. Whatever may be the balance of poetical
merit, Mr. Scott, we are quite sure, has always been a much better
courtier than Mr. Southey; and we are of opinion that the honours
of a Court can nowhere be so gracefully or deservedly bestowed as
on its followers. His acceptance of this mark of court favour would
not have broken in upon that uniformity of character, which we think
no less beautiful and becoming in life than in a poem. But, perhaps,
a passion for new faces extends to the intrigues of politics as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of love; and a triumph over the scruples of delicacy enhances the
value of the conquest in both cases. To <em>have been</em> the poet of the
people, may not render Mr. Southey less a court favourite; and one
of his old Sonnets to Liberty must give a peculiar zest to his new
Birth-day Odes. His flaming patriotism will easily subside into the
gentle glow of grateful loyalty; and the most extravagant of his plans
of reform end in building castles in Spain!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>MR. SOUTHEY’S NEW-YEAR’S ODE</h3>

<div class='lg-container-r c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Jan. 8, 1814.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Southey’s Ode has at length appeared—not as was announced,
under the title of ‘Carmen Annuum,’ but under that of ‘<span class='sc'>Carmen
Triumphale</span>, <em>for the Commencement of the Year 1814</em>.’ We see no
reason why the author might not have adopted the title of Horace’s
Ode entire, and have called it <em>Carmen Seculare</em>, which would have
been the best account he could give of it. We fear Mr. Southey
will not form a splendid exception to the numberless instances which
prove that there is something in the air of a court, not favourable to
the genius of poetry. He has not deprived himself of the excuse
made by one of his predecessors, of versatile memory, in extenuation
of the degeneracy of his courtly lays,—‘That poets succeed best in
fiction.’ The Ode is in the ballad style, peculiar to Mr. Southey
and his poetical friends. It has something of the rustic simplicity of
a country virgin on her first introduction at Duke’s Place, or of
Pamela on the day of her marriage with Mr. B. Or rather it
resembles a <em>fancy</em> birth-day suit, a fashionable livery worn inside out,
a prince’s feather with a sprig of the tree of liberty added to it,—the
academy of compliments turned into quaint Pindarics,—is a sort of
methodistical rhapsody, chaunted by a gentleman-usher, and exhibits
the irregular vigour of Jacobin enthusiasm suffering strange emasculation
under the hands of a finical lord-chamberlain. It is romantic
without interest, and tame without elegance. It is exactly such an
ode as we expected Mr. Southey to compose on this occasion. We
say this from our respect for the talents and character of this eminent
writer. He is the last man whom we should expect to see graceful
in fetters, or from whom we should look for the soul of freedom
within the <em>liberties of a court</em>!—The commencement of the Ode is as
follows, and it continues throughout much as it begins:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘In happy hour <em>doth</em> he receive</div>
      <div class='line'>The Laurel, meed of famous bards of <em>yore</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which Dryden and diviner Spenser wore,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span><em>In happy hour</em>, and well may he rejoice,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose earliest task <em>must be</em></div>
      <div class='line'>To raise the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exultant</span></i> hymn for <em>victory</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>And <em>join</em> a nation’s <em>joy</em> with harp and voice,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pouring the strain of triumph on the wind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Glory to God, his song—deliverance to mankind!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Wake, lute and harp! &amp;c. &amp;c.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Southey has not exactly followed the suggestion of an ingenious
friend, to begin his poem with the appropriate allusion,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Awake, my sack-but!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The following rhymes are the lamest we observed. He says,
speaking of the conflict between the Moors and Spaniards,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>‘Age after age, from sire to <em>son</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>The hallowed sword was handed <em>down</em>;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor did they from that warfare cease,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sheath that hallowed sword in peace,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Until the work was <em>done</em>.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Indeed, if Mr. S. can do no better than this, in his drawing-room
verses, he should get some contributor to the Lady’s Magazine to
polish them for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have turned over the Ode again, which extends to twenty
pages, in the hope of finding some one vigorous or striking passage
for selection, but in vain. The following is the most likely to please
in a certain quarter:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>‘Open thy gates, O Hanover! display</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thy loyal banners to the day!</div>
      <div class='line'>Receive thy old illustrious line once more!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Beneath an upstart’s yoke oppress’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Long has it been thy fortune to deplore</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That line, whose fostering and paternal sway</div>
      <div class='line'>So many an age thy grateful children blest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The yoke is broken now!—a mightier hand</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath dash’d—in pieces dash’d—the iron rod.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To meet her princes, the delivered land</div>
      <div class='line'>Pours her rejoicing multitudes abroad;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The happy bells, from every town and tower,</div>
      <div class='line'>Roll their glad peals upon the joyful wind;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And from all hearts and tongues, with one consent,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The high thanksgiving strain is sent—</div>
      <div class='line'>Glory to God! Deliverance to mankind!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In various stanzas, Bonaparte is called an upstart, a ruffian, &amp;c.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>We confess, we wish to see Mr. Southey, like Virgil, in his
Georgics, ‘scatter his dung with a grace.’</p>

<p class='c010'>We do not intend to quarrel with our Laureat’s poetical politics,
but the conclusion is one which we did not anticipate from the
author. We have always understood that the Muses were the
daughters of Memory!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And France, <em>restored</em> and shaking off her chain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall join the Avengers in the joyful strain—</div>
      <div class='line'>Glory to God! Deliverance for mankind!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The poem has a few notes added to it, the object of which seems
to be to criticise the political opinions of the Edinburgh Reviewers
with respect to Spain, and to prove that the author is wiser after
the event than they were before it, in which he has very nearly
succeeded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Southey announces a new volume of Inscriptions, which must

<p class='c013'>Sir, The method of taking this bird is somewhat singular, and is
described in an old book in the following terms:</p>

<p class='c010'>‘The Dottrel is a foolish bird of the crane species, very tall,
awkward, and conceited. The Dottrel-catcher, when he has got
near enough, turns his head round sideways, and <em>makes a leg</em> towards
him: the bird, seeing this, returns the civility, and makes the same
sidelong movement. These advances are repeated with mutual
satisfaction, till the man approaches near enough, and then the bird
is taken.’</p>

<p class='c010'>A poet-laureat or a treasury sophist is often taken much in the
same way. Your Opposionist, Sir, was ever a true <em>gull</em>. From
the general want of sympathy, he sets more store by it than it is
worth; and for the smallest concession, is prevailed upon to give
up every principle, and to surrender himself, bound hand and foot,
the slave of a party, who get all they want of him, and then—‘Spunge,
you are dry again!’</p>

<p class='c010'>A striking illustration of the common treatment of political
drudges has lately occurred in the instance of a celebrated writer,
whose lucubrations are withheld from the public, because he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>declared against the project of restoring the Bourbons. As the
court and city politicians have spoken out on this subject, permit
me, Sir, to say a word in behalf of the country. I have no dislike
whatever, private or public, to the Bourbons, except as they may
be made the pretext for mischievous and impracticable schemes.
At the same time I have not the slightest enthusiasm in their favour.
I would not sacrifice the life or limb of a single individual to restore
them. I have very nearly the same feelings towards them which
Swift has expressed in his account of the ancient and venerable race
of the Struldbruggs. It is true, they might in some respects present
a direct contrast to Bonaparte. A tortoise placed on the throne of
France would do the same thing. The literary sycophants of the
day, Sir, are greatly enamoured (from some cause or other) with
hereditary imbecility and native want of talent. They are angry,
not without reason, that a Corsican upstart has made the princes of
Europe look like wax-work figures, and given a shock to the still
life of kings. They wish to punish this unpardonable presumption,
by establishing an artificial balance of <em>weakness</em> throughout Europe,
and by reducing humanity to the level of thrones. We may perhaps
in time improve this principle of ricketty admiration to Eastern
perfection, where every changeling is held sacred, and that which
is the disgrace of human intellect is hailed as the image of the
Divinity!</p>

<p class='c010'>It is said that in France the old royalists and the revolutionary
republicans are agreed in the same point. Bonaparte is the point of
union between these opposite extremes, the common object of their
hate and fear. I can conceive this very possible from what I have
observed among ourselves. He has certainly done a great deal to
mortify the pride of birth in the one, and the vanity of personal
talents in the others. This is a very sufficient ground of private
pique and resentment, but not of national calamity or eternal war.
I am, Sir, your humble servant,</p>

      <div class='line'><em>Dec. 6, 1813.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The following paragraph in a daily paper is equally worthy of notice
for magnificence of expression and magnanimity of sentiment:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘When or under what circumstances the great Commander may
think fit to carry his forces against the large military or commercial
depôts of the south of France, we do not pretend to form conjectures.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>We are confident, that as nothing will disturb the calm and
meditative prudence of his plans, so nothing will arrest the rapidity
of their execution. We trust alike in his caution and in his resolution:
but, perhaps, there may be in store for him a higher destination
than the capture of a town or the reduction of a province. What
if the army opposed to him should resolve to avenge the cause of
humanity, and to exchange the bloody and brutal tyranny of a
Bonaparte for the mild paternal sway of a Bourbon? Could a
popular French general open to himself a more glorious career at
the present moment, than that which Providence seemed to have
destined to the virtuous Moreau? Or is it possible that any power
now existing in France could stop such a general and such an army,
supported by the unconquered Wellington and his formidable legions,
if they were to resolve boldly to march to Paris, and bring the
usurper to the block! Every disposable soldier in France is on the
Adour, or on the Rhine. In the case we are supposing, there
would be no enemy to encounter, unless the northern frontier were
at once denuded of troops, and the road to Paris on that side laid
open to the allies. This is no question of the attachment of the
French nation to one dynasty or to another: it is a question of military
enterprise, in the minds of military adventurers. The simple possibility,
not to say the high moral probability, that in a moment of
general defection, an army which has so much in its hands may run
with the stream of popular feeling throughout Europe, is enough to
make the tyrant tremble on his throne. Lord Wellington is doubtless
prepared to take advantage of so desirable an occurrence, in case
it should happen without his previous interference: but we wish him
to interfere; we wish that he were authorised plainly and openly to
offer his mighty co-operation to any body of men who would shake
off the Tyrant’s yoke in France, as has been done in Italy, in
Germany, and in Holland!’</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a fair specimen of that kind of declamation which has for
a long time swayed the affairs of Europe, and which, if the powers
of Europe are wise by experience, will not influence them much
longer. It is this spirit of treating the French people as of a
different species from ourselves—as a monster or a non-entity—of
disposing of their government at the will of every paragraph-monger—of
arming our hatred against them by ridiculous menaces and
incessant reproaches—of supposing that their power was either so
tremendous as to threaten the existence of all nations, or so contemptible
that we could crush it by a word,—it is this uniform
system, practised by the incendiaries of the press, of inflaming our
prejudices and irritating our passions, that has so often made us rush
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>upon disaster, and submit to every extremity rather than forego the
rancorous and headstrong desire of revenge.</p>

<p class='c010'>The writer of the paragraph talks familiarly of marching to Paris,
and bringing Bonaparte to the block. He seems to wonder at the
delay which has already taken place. This is the very style of
ancient Pistol, ‘Bid him prepare, for I will cut his throat.’ This
high tone of impotent menace and premature triumph always ‘reverbs
its own hollowness.’ It is the echo of fear. Instead of a proud
repose on our own strength and courage, these writers only feel
secure in the destruction of an adversary. The natural intoxication
of success is heightened into a sort of delirium by the recollection of
the panic into which they had been thrown. <cite>The Times’</cite> editor thinks
that nothing can be so easy as for an army ‘to run with the stream
of popular feeling’ from one end of Europe to the other. Strange
that these persons, like desperate adventurers, are incorrigible to
experience. They are always setting out on the same forlorn hope.
The tide of fortune, while it sets in strong against us, they prove to
be the most variable of all things; but it no sooner changes in our
favour, than it straight</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Flows on to the Propontic,</div>
      <div class='line'>And knows no ebb.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>To encourage themselves in the extravagance of their voluntary
delusions, they are as prodigal of titles of honour as the college of
heralds, and erect a standard of military fame, with all the authority,
but not with the impartiality of history. Lord Wellington is ‘the
great commander,’ and ‘the unconquered general,’ while ‘the little
captain,’ and ‘the hero’ or ‘the deserter of Smorgonne,’ are the
only qualifications of Bonaparte. If such are the true denominations
and relative proportions of these two generals, then it is quite right
to give to each of them the honour due;—if they are not, then it is
quite wrong to stake the welfare of nations on a turn of expression—to
put little equivocal scraps of paper into false scales, and decide the
fate of Europe by nicknames. The scales in which Sir Humphrey
Davy weighs the 500th part of a drachm, are not so slight nor
insignificant as those in which his vilifiers, <cite>The Times</cite>, balance the
destinies of the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What,’ it is asked with a certain air of profundity and mystery,
‘What if the army opposed to him [Lord Wellington] should
resolve to exchange the bloody tyranny of Bonaparte for the paternal
sway of a Bourbon!’</p>

<p class='c010'>Why, if the French wish to shake off the galling yoke of a
military Usurper, we say, let them do it in God’s name. Let them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>whenever they please, imitate us in our recal of the Stuarts; and,
whenever they please, in our banishment of them thirty years afterwards.
But let them not, in the name of honour or of manhood,
receive the royal boon of liberty at the point of the bayonet. It
would be setting a bad precedent—it would be breaking in upon a
great principle—it would be making a gap in the general feeling of
national independence. For we are to observe, that this rational,
popular, patriotic preference of the mild paternal sway of the Bourbons
is to be enforced upon them by the powerful co-operation of the unconquered
Wellington and his formidable legions. This is, in fact,
returning to the original ground of the whole quarrel, and the question
for them to consider, is whether all the evils and miseries which they
may have endured in resisting these forcible appeals from foreign
powers, are the strongest reasons why they should at length gratefully
resign themselves to that tender concern for their sufferings, which
so much persevering kindness, and disinterested preference of their
interests to our own unequivocally proves. The impression produced
by these formidable emissaries of mild paternity must, indeed, be
only that of filial love and reverence. The constant <em>role</em> of these
same Bourbons, now recognized, now disowned by the surrounding
states, now held up as bugbears to frighten, and now brought forward
as decoys to allure them, for awhile kept entirely in the back-ground,
and then again set over them like puppets, in every reverse of fortune,
must excite, one would suppose, some very pleasant associations, and
give them some little insight into the nature of the machinery which
is played off against them. In other nations, at least, these sort of
<em>tentatives</em> would lead not to submission, but to indignation. It
cannot be denied, however, that the French character has peculiar
susceptibilities. France, like a modern coquet, may be fascinated
once more by the courtly graces of discarded royalty; or, on the
other hand, recollecting the malice and the impotence of which she
was so long the victim, like Hellenore, entertained by the jolly
satyrs, may wisely refuse to return to the cold and irksome embraces
of the drivelling Malbecco. But our politician wishes all this not
to be left to their own free will, but that we should interfere. We
can easily believe it; ‘it was ever the fault of our English nation’
to wish to interfere with what did not concern them, for the very
reason that they could interfere with comparative impunity. What
is sport to them is death to others. The writer also draws a parallel,
as if it were a feasible case, between Holland, Spain, and Germany
throwing off a foreign yoke, and the French throwing off their own;
in other words, submitting to a foreign one. We beg pardon of these
acute discriminators. We know they have an answer. We leave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>them in possession of the nice distinction—between a foreign yoke,
and a yoke imposed by foreigners!</p>

<p class='c010'>‘This,’ says the writer in <cite>The Times</cite>, ‘is not a question of attachment
to one dynasty or another, but a question of military enterprize
between military adventurers.’ Does our speculator mean by this
to confer the privileges of military adventurers, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en plein droit</span></i>, on the
Emperor Alexander and the Crown Prince of Sweden? But whatever
he means, it is clear that he is not consistent in what he says;
for he has said just before, that the object of this so often repeated
march to Paris is ‘to bring the Usurper to the block!’ Here, then,
it is a question, not between contending generals, but between a
usurper and a lawful monarch. So true it is that those who have
most need of their assistance have the worst memories! ‘What,’
exclaims our enthusiast, ‘would there be to oppose such a general
and such an army, aided by the unconquered Wellington,’ &amp;c.
First, ‘this is the very coinage of his brain.’ There’s no such
general and no such army.</p>

<p class='c010'>But granting the supposition to be true, the patriotic general, who
should open to himself a glorious passage through the heart of his
country, and attempt to make it the vassal of England, under the
monstrous pretence of allegiance to his Sovereign, might perhaps
meet the fate which Providence destined for the virtuous Moreau.
Perhaps the French may think that as their affected loyalty could be
only a cover for the most dastardly submission, so their hypocrisy
and treachery to themselves might be justly retaliated upon them, by
making the restoration of thrones a mask for the dismemberment of
kingdoms. They may have acquired by experience some knowledge
of that enlargement of view and boldness of nerve, which is inspired
by the elevation of success. They may consider, that ‘when the
wild and savage passions are set afloat, they are not so easily regulated’
according to the dictates of justice or generosity. Some of them may
even go so far as to think that all the respect of the Emperor of
Russia for the talents and virtues of Moreau might be insufficient to
deter him from memorizing another Warsaw at Paris! Of this we
are tolerably certain, that there are not wanting staunch friends of
order and civilization in this country who would advise and applaud
such a catastrophe ‘to the very echo,’ as a masterpiece of political
justice, chaunt <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</span></i> over the ruins, and very seriously invite the
good people of France to join in the chorus! But we are not ‘the
echo that shall applaud again.’ We shall not hail such a catastrophe,
nor such a triumph. For out of the desolation would arise a poisoned
stench that would choak almost the breath of life, and one low,
creeping fog of universal despotism, that would confound the Eastern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>and the Western world together <em>in darkness that might be felt</em>. We
do not wish for this final consummation, because we do not wish the
pulse of liberty to be quite destroyed, or that the mass of our common
nature should become a lifeless corpse, unable to rouse itself against
never-ending wrongs, or that the last spark of generous enthusiasm
should be extinguished in that moral atheism, which defaces and
mangles the image of God in man. We do not wish that liberty
should ever have a deer’s heart given her, to live in constant fear of
the fatal, inevitable venal pack behind her; but that she may still have
the heart of a lioness, whose mighty roar keeps the hunters at bay,
and whose whelps revenge their parent’s death!</p>

<p class='c010'>Rather than such an event should take place, if such an extremity
were possible, we should even wish that a general and an army of our
own, devoted by <cite>The Times</cite> to a far different service, might be
empowered to make a firm stand against it: to stop the tide of
barbarous despotism as they had already rolled back that of ungovernable
ambition, and to say, Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further.
Such an interference in such a cause would indeed give to Great
Britain the character which she claims of being the Vindicator of the
World. It would be to assume an attitude and a port indeed, loftier
than she ever yet presented to the admiration of mankind; and would
create a bulwark of strength round her, that would encircle her as
with ‘impaling fire’!</p>

<p class='c013'>This patriot and logician in a letter in <cite>The Times</cite> of Friday, labours
to stifle the most distant hope of peace in its birth. He lays down
certain general principles which must for ever render all attempts to
restore it vain and abortive. With the watchword of <cite>Eternal war
with Bonaparte</cite> blazoned on his forehead, in the piety of his pacific
zeal, he challenges Bonaparte as the wanton, unprovoked, implacable
enemy of the peace of mankind. We will also venture to lay down
a maxim, which is—That from the moment that one party declares
and acts upon the avowed principle that peace can never be made with
an enemy, it renders war on the part of that enemy a matter of
necessary self-defence, and holds out a plea for every excess of
ambition or revenge. If we are to limit our hostility to others only
with their destruction, we impose the adoption of the same principle
on them as their only means of safety. There is no alternative. But
this is probably the issue to which Vetus wishes to bring the question.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>This writer not only outlaws Bonaparte, but in a summary way, disfranchises
the French nation at large of the right of making peace or
war. ‘Who,’ he exclaims in wanton defiance of common sense,
‘are the French nation? To us a rank non-entity. We have only
to do with Napoleon Bonaparte—with his rights, his interests, his
honour. Who are to be the sole judges of his rights? We and our
allies!’ Admirable politician!</p>

<p class='c010'>The events which have lately taken place on the Continent, and
the moderate and manly tone in which those events have been received
by Ministers, have excited the utmost degree of uneasiness and alarm
in the minds of certain persons, who redouble the eagerness of their
cries for war. The cold blooded fury and mercenary malice of these
panders to mischief, can only be appeased by the prospect of lasting
desolation. They rave, foam at the mouth, and make frantic gestures
at the name of peace. These high-priests of Moloch daily offer up
to their grim idol the same nauseous banquet of abuse and lies.
Round them ‘a cry of hell-hounds never ceasing bark,’ that with
greedy appetite devour the offal. Every day they act over the same
foul imposture, and repeat their monstrous masque. These mighty
soothsayers look forward to another restoration of Europe after
another twenty years of havoc and destruction. After urging her to
the very edge of the precipice from which she has only just recovered,
breathless and affrighted, they wish to goad her on once more to the
same mad career. The storm is for the moment over-past, but they
will not suffer the vessel of the state to enter the harbour, in the hope
that they may still plunder the wreck, and prey upon the carcases.
The serpent’s hiss, the assassin’s yell, the mowing and chattering of
apes, drown the voice of peace; and Vetus, like the solemn owl,
joins in the distance, and prolongs the dreary note of death!</p>

      <div class='line'><em>Jan. 21, 1814.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The following passage, among others of the same <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calibre</span></i>, has lately
appeared in <cite>The Courier</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c016'>‘The party call upon us to speak out. We thought it not very easy for
any charge of not speaking out to be urged against us. However, we obey
their call most willingly. “Does <cite>The Courier</cite>, they ask, mean to insinuate,
that because the South of France is more inclined to favour their pretensions,
the Bourbons ought to have frigates allotted them to traverse the
Bay of Biscay, and join the standard of Lord Wellington?” To this we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>reply, yes; decisively yes!—We say we would have a Bourbon proceed to
the South of France. We hope we have spoken out on this point. One
more remains;—Would we “set up some new obstacle to the progress of
the negociation that is on foot?” <em>Yes, if we thought there was any
negociation on foot with Bonaparte. But we trust there is not—we trust
there never will be.</em>’</p>

<p class='c010'>And this at a time when it has been formally signified from the
throne that there was no objection on the part of England to treat with
the French Ruler; when Lord Liverpool has said publicly that no
conditions of peace would be insisted on, which we, placed in the
situation of France, should not think it reasonable to grant; when
we, in concert with the Allies, have announced to France, that it is
neither our intention nor our wish to interfere with their internal
government, but to secure the independence and safety of the continent;
and when Lord Castlereagh has gone from this country for
the purpose, avowed and understood, of giving effect to that declaration,
and of fixing the basis of a peace to be recognized by the
common powers of Europe. To produce such a passage, at such a
moment, required that union of impudence and folly which has no
parallel elsewhere. From the quarter from which it comes, it could
not surprize us; it is consistent; it is in keeping; it is of a piece
with the rest. It is worthy of those harpies of the press, whose
business is to scare away the approach of peace by their obscene and
dissonant noises, and to tear asunder the olive-branch, whenever it is
held out to us, with their well-practised beaks; who fill their hearts
with malice, and their mouths with falsehood; who strive to soothe
the dastard passion of their employers by inflaming those of the
multitude; creatures that would sell the lives of millions for a nod
of greatness, and make their country a by-word in history, to please
some punk of quality.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are to understand from no less an authority than that of <cite>The
Courier</cite>, that Lord Castlereagh is sent out professedly to make peace,
but in reality to hinder it: and we learn from an authority equally
respectable (<cite>The Times</cite>) that nothing can prevent the destruction of
Bonaparte but this country’s untimely consenting to make peace with
him. And yet we are told in the same breath, that the charge of
eternal war which we bring against these writers, is the echo of the
French war-faction, who, at the commencement of every series of
hostilities, and at the conclusion of every treaty, have accused this
country of a want of good faith and sincere disposition to peace.
We are told, that if the French do not force Bonaparte to make peace
now, which yet these writers are determined to prevent him from
doing, ‘they are sunk beneath the worshippers of cats and onions.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>These ‘knavish but keen’ politicians tell the French people in so
many words—‘We will not make peace with your government, and
yet, if it does not make peace with us, we will force what Government
we please upon you.’ What effect this monstrous and palpable insult
must have upon the French nation, will depend upon the degree of
sense and spirit they have left among them. But with respect to ourselves,
if the line of policy pointed out by these juggling fiends is
really meant to be pursued, if a pretended proposal to treat for peace
on certain grounds is only to be converted into an insidious ground of
renewed war for other purposes, if this offensive and unmanly imposture
is to be avowed and practised upon us in the face of day, then
we know what will be the duty of Parliament and of the country.
The wars, in which the Governments of Europe have been engaged,
have not succeeded the worse when the people took an effective share
in them. We should hope that the interference of the people will
not be necessary to effect the restoration of peace.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is curious to hear these systematic opponents of peace, (with
infuriate and insensate looks scattering firebrands and death,) at the
same time affecting the most tender concern for the miseries of war;
or like that good-natured reconciler of differences, <em>Iago</em>, hypocritically
shifting the blame from themselves—‘What, stab men in the dark!’
They ask with grave faces, with <em>very</em> grave faces, ‘Who are the
authors, the propagators, and practisers of this dreadful war system?
who the aggressors? who the unrelenting persecutors of peace?’
War is their everlasting cry, ‘one note day and night;’ during war,
during peace, during negociation, in success, in adversity; and yet
they dare to tax others as the <em>sole</em> authors of the calamities which they
would render eternal, sooner than abate one jot of their rancorous prejudices.
One of these writers (the Editor of <cite>The Times</cite>) asserts with
an air of great confidence, while he himself is hallooing as loud as he
can among the indefatigable war-pack, that Bonaparte is the cause,
the <em>sole author</em> of all the calamities of Europe for the last fourteen
years; and what is remarkable, he brings as a proof of this sweeping
assertion, a state paper, written under the Pitt Administration of
<em>pacific memory</em>, deprecating <em>all</em> conciliation with the French at the
very period from which the writer dates the wanton, unprovoked
aggressions of Bonaparte, and which paper he quotes at length, as an
admirable description of the mode by which we are to avert the
calamities of Europe for the next fourteen years, as we have done for
the last. Better late than never. So industrious an inquirer need
not despair of effectually averting our future miseries, and pacifying
the world, if it is to be done by referring back to state papers of this
description, or by resuming the principles of those good old anti-jacobin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>times, or by finishing the war as it was begun. There would
be no end of precedents and documents for prosecuting the war with
vigour under every variety of circumstances, in order never to bring
it to a conclusion. As a proof of the aggressions and implacable
hatred of France, he might cite that monument of romantic and
disinterested generosity ‘of heroic sentiment and manly enterprise,’
on the part of the Allies, the treaty of Pilnitz.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a> He might proceed
to those pacific manifestations—Lord Hawkesbury’s march to Paris—the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bellum internecinum</span></i> of Mr. Windham, and his consistent phrenzy
at the treaty of Amiens—Mr. Pitt’s abstract impossibility of maintaining
the relations of peace and amity with the French Republic,
or with the child and champion of Jacobinism—Mr. Burke’s
Regicide Peace—the project of starving France in 1796—of hurling
her down the gulph of bankruptcy in 1797—the coalitions of different
periods in which England saved herself and Europe <em>from peace</em> by her
energy, or her example—the contemptuous rejection of every offer of
negociation in every situation, the unwearied prosecution of the war
on the avowed principle that we were never to leave it off as long as
we could carry it on, or get any one to carry it on for us, or till we
had buried ourselves under the ruins of the civilized world (a prediction
which we narrowly escaped verifying)—all these undeniable
proofs and substantial demonstrations of our fond desires, our longings
after peace, and of the determination of France to aggrandize herself
by war and conquest, would, indeed, with the ingenious glosses of
our well-meaning commentator form a very entertaining volume, and
would at least teach us, if not what to follow, what we ought to shun,
in our future advances to this first of earthly blessings, so long and
studiously and systematically withheld from us—only to render its
attainment more certain and more precious!</p>

<p class='c010'>To the other solid grounds of an indefinite prolongation of this
war, religious, moral, political, commercial, constitutional, continental,
Jacobinical, Revolutionary, Corsican, foreign or domestic—our
apologist, in the true spirit of the French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit maitre</span></i> in <cite>Roderic
Random</cite>, has now added a ground of his own, of equal efficacy and
validity with the former, viz. that we are to carry it on in the
character of gentlemen and men of honour. We are to fight for the
restoration of the Bourbons, say <cite>The Times</cite>, ‘that we may have gentlemen
and men of honour to fight with.’ There is some prudence in
this resolution; it goes on the old principle, that we are not to fight
except with our <em>match</em>. Don Quixote, after he had been soundly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>drubbed by the Yanguesian carriers, recollected that he ought not to
have engaged with plebeians. The writer whom we have here quoted,
told us, some time ago, from a greater authority certainly than that of
<cite>The Times</cite>, the true grounds of war, or ‘that we might spill our blood
for our country, for our liberty, for our friends, for our kind;’ but we
do not remember, among these legitimate sources of the waste of
human blood, that we were to shed it for a punctilio. If war were
to be decided by the breaking of white and black sticks among
gentlemen-ushers, or even by the effusion of courtly phrases in
<cite>The Courier</cite> and <cite>The Times</cite>, we should have no objection to this
fastidious refinement; but we cannot consent to shed the best blood
of Europe, nor that of ‘the meanest peasant in this our native land,’
in order that the delicate honour of the Carlton House Minority may
not be stained, nor the purity of their moral taste perverted, by an
intercourse with any but gentlemen and men of honour. And thou,
Carl John, what hast thou to say to this new plea of the old school?—Or
why, not being clad with the inherent right to ‘monarchize, be
feared, and kill with looks,’—dost thou insult over the King of
Denmark, menace Holstein, and seize upon Norway, and yet tellest
thy little son, that the time is coming, when conquerors shall be no
more?—<cite>The Times’</cite> editor scornfully rejects our practical opinion
on the probability of restoring the Bourbons, because it seems
we always reject every proposition that makes the continuance of
war necessary. Be it so. But do not these persons also attach
the highest degree of probability, or, when they are so inclined,
moral certainty, to every thing that tends to make peace unattainable?
It is true we did not, as they say, anticipate the
reverses of the French Emperor before they happened. If we did
not anticipate them before, it was because we had nothing in past
experience to guide us to such a conclusion, except, indeed, the
constant unverified predictions of <cite>The Times</cite> and <cite>The Courier</cite>.
If these inspired writers had the slightest intimation of them one
moment before they happened, we are willing to bow down to
them, and they shall be our Gods. But of this we are sure, from
all experience, that the way to render the fruits of those reverses
uncertain, or to defeat them altogether, is the very mode of proceeding
recommended by the ceaseless partizans of interminable
hostilities. If the French are a nation of men—if they have the
common faculties of memory, of understanding, and foresight; if
they are, as they have been pronounced by one no ways favourable
to them, ‘the most civilized, and with one exception, the most
enlightened people in Europe,’ surely, if any thing can kindle in
their minds ‘the flame of sacred vehemence, and move the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>stones to mutiny,’ it is the letting loose upon them the mohawks
of Europe, the Cossacks, with General Blucher’s manifesto in
their hands. It is restoring to Bonaparte the very weapon
which we had wrested from him, the mighty plea of the independence
of nations; it is reclothing his power with those adamantine
scales ‘which fear no discipline of human hands,’ the
hearts and wills of a whole people, threatened with emasculation
of their moral and physical powers, by half a dozen libellers of
the human species, and a horde of barbarians scarcely human.
Even the writer in <cite>The Times</cite> acknowledges that the Cossacks
entering France as a sort of masters of the ceremonies to the
Bourbons, is only better, and less likely to excite horror and dismay,
than their entering it in their own rights and persons. It
may be so. The bear bringing in the monkey on his back may
be more inviting than the bear alone. But we should think that
either portent must be fatal, that neither hieroglyphic will be
favourably interpreted.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a degree of shameless effrontery which disarms and
baffles contempt by the shock which it gives to every feeling of
moral rectitude or common decency; as there is a daring extravagance
in absurdity which almost challenges our assent by confounding
and setting at defiance every principle of human reasoning.
The ribald paragraphs, which fill the columns of our daily papers,
and disgrace the English language, afford too many examples of
the former assertion; the Letters of Vetus are a striking instance of
the latter.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would have been some satisfaction to us, in the ungrateful
task which we had imposed upon ourselves, if, in combating the
conclusions of Vetus, we could have done justice to the ingenuity
of his arguments, or the force of his illustrations. But his extreme
dogmatism is as destitute of proofs, as it is violent in itself.
His profound axioms are in general flat contradictions; and he
scarcely makes a single statement in support of any proposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>which does not subvert it. In the Parliamentary phrase, he constantly
<em>stultifies</em> himself. The glaring and almost deliberate incongruity
of his conclusion is such as to imply a morbid defect of
comprehension, a warped or overstrained understanding. Absorbed
in an inveterate purpose, bent on expanding some vapid sophism
into a cumbrous system, he is insensible to the most obvious consequences
of things; and his reason is made the blind pander to his
prejudices.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are not converts to this author’s style, any more than to his
reasoning. Indeed the defects of the one very much assist those
of the other, and both have the same character. There is a perpetual
effort to make something out of nothing, and to elevate a
common-place into sublimity. The style of Vetus is not very
different from that of Don Adriano de Armado; every word is as
who should say, ‘I am Sir Oracle.’ Like the hero of Cervantes,
haranguing the shepherds, he assaults the very vault of Heaven
with the arrogance of his tone, and the loudness of his pretensions.
Nothing can exceed the pompous quaintness, and laborious foolery
of many of his letters. He unfolds the book of fate, assumes
the prophet or historian, by virtue of alliteration and antithesis;—sustains
the balance of power by well-poised periods, or crushes
a people under a ponderous epithet. The set style of Vetus does
not conform easily to the march of human affairs; and he is
often forced to torture the sense to ‘hitch it’ in a metaphor. While
he is marshalling his words, he neglects his arguments, which
require all his attention to connect them together; and in his eagerness
to give additional significance to his sentences, he loses his own
meaning.</p>

<p class='c010'>We shall proceed to the task we at first proposed, viz. that of
supplying marginal notes to the voluminous effusions of Vetus,
and shall continue our comments as often as he furnishes us with
the text.</p>

<p class='c010'>We agree with the sentiment with which he commences his
last Letter, that it is ‘particularly desirable to follow up the
question of peace’ at the present crisis, but not with the reason
which he assigns for his extreme anxiety to enter upon the question,
‘because this is just the moment to dread the entertainment of
a pacific overture.’ We can readily believe that at no other
moment than when he dreads its approach, would Vetus ever
breathe a syllable on the subject of peace, and then only to avert
it. Whenever ‘a spurious and mawkish beneficence’ gives an
alarm of peace, the dogs of war stand ready on the slip to hunt it
down.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>‘I have stated to you’ (<em>To the Editor of the Times</em>) ‘as the
only legitimate basis of a treaty, if not on the part of the continental
Allies, at least for England herself, that <em>she should conquer
all she can, and keep all she conquers</em>. This is not by way of
retaliation, <em>however just</em>, upon so obdurate and rapacious an enemy—but
as an indispensable condition of her own safety and existence.’</p>

<p class='c010'>That which is here said to be the <em>only</em> legitimate basis of a
treaty is one, which if admitted and acted upon, would make it
impossible that any treaty should ever be formed. It is a basis,
not of lasting peace, but of endless war. To call that the basis
of a treaty which precludes the possibility of any concession or
compensation, of every consideration either of the right or power
of each party to retain its actual acquisitions, is one of those misnomers
which the gravity of Vetus’s manner makes his readers
overlook. After the imposing and guarded exordium which
ushers in the definition of our only legitimate basis of a treaty,
we are not prepared to expect Vetus’s burlesque solution of the
difficulty—‘that we are not to treat at all.’ The human mind
is naturally credulous of sounding professions, and reluctantly
admits the existence of what is very common, and common for that
reason—<em>pompous nonsense</em>. It seems, however, that this basis
of a treaty is to apply only to one of the contracting powers,
namely, England, it is equivocal as to the Allies, and with respect
to France, it is, we suppose, meant to be altogether null. For
in a former letter, after asking, ‘Who are to be the judges of
his (Bonaparte’s) rights?’ he answers emphatically, ‘We and
our Allies!’ Bobadil did not come up to this exquisite pacificator
of the world! To make common sense of Vetus’s axiom
with reference to any state whatever, ‘that it should keep all it
conquers,’ it seems necessary to add this trifling condition, ‘if it
can.’ And with respect to Great Britain in particular, if from
her peculiar situation she has the power to keep all she conquers
without being amenable to any other tribunal than her own will,
this very circumstance proves that the exercise of that power is
not <em>necessary to her safety and existence</em>. Again, if England has
an interest of her own, quite independent on and separate from
that of the continent, what has she to do with continental Allies?
If her interests may be and are interwoven with those of the rest
of Europe, is it too much to expect from her a common sacrifice
to the common cause? We quarrel with France on continental
grounds; we strip her of her colonies to support the quarrel; and yet
we refuse to restore any part of them, in order to secure peace. If
so, we are only ostensible parties in the contest, and in reality robbers.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>‘The first policy of a wise people is to make rival nations
afraid to disturb them, to impress their enemies with a <em>terrific
sense</em>,’ (how magnificent is this epic mode of expression) ‘that
to attack them is to suffer not only transient defeats, but deep,
grievous, and <em>irrecoverable losses</em>; and to hold in abhorrence any
peace which shall not be a living record of <em>their own superiority</em>, and
a monument worthy of those warriors, through whose noble blood
it was obtained.’</p>

<p class='c010'>If the losses sustained in war were to be irrecoverable, it is
easy to foresee that the seat of empires would be very soon
changed in almost all cases whatever. But Vetus here, as is
customary with him when it tends to enforce the hyperbolical
effect of his style, assumes as a broad ground of national wisdom,
a physical impossibility. It is not in the nature of things that the
losses of rival States should be irrecoverable. Vetus would do
better to decree at once that the possessions of nations are <em>unassailable</em>
as well as <em>irrecoverable</em>, which would prevent war
altogether. But still more preposterous is the madness or malice of
the assertion, that no peace can be made by a wise nation, which
is not a living record of <em>their own superiority</em>. ‘This is the key-stone
which makes up the arch’ of Vetus’s indestructible war-system.
Can it have escaped even the short-sighted logic of this
writer, that to make superiority an indispensable condition of a
wise peace is to proscribe peace altogether, because certainly this
superiority cannot belong at the same time to both parties, and
yet we conceive that the consent of both parties is necessary to a
peace? Any other peace, we are told, than that which is at all
times impracticable between rival states, ought not only never to
be made, but it ought to be held in abhorrence, we ought to
shudder at its approach as the last of evils, and throw it to an
immeasurable distance from us. This is indeed closing up the
avenues to peace, and shutting the gates of mercy on mankind,
in a most consummate and scientific manner. Our philosophic
rhetorician appears also to forget, in that high tone in which he
speaks of the <em>monuments raised by the noble blood of warriors</em>,
that these sort of monuments are cemented by the blood of others
as well as by our own, and tell the survivors a double story.
His heated imagination seems to have been worked up into a
literal belief of his own assertion, that the French nation are a
rank non-entity; or he supposes that there is some celestial ichor
in our veins, which we alone shed for our country, while other
nations neither bleed nor suffer from war, nor have a right to
profit by peace. This may be very well in poetry, or on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>stage, but it will not pass current in diplomacy. Vetus, indeed,
strains hard to reconcile inconsistencies, and to found the laws of
nations on the sentiments of exclusive patriotism. But we should
think that the common rules of peace and war, which necessarily
involve the rights, interests, and feelings of different nations, cannot
be dictated by the heroic caprices of a few hair-brained egotists, on
either side of the question.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Nothing,’ continues Vetus, ‘can be more opposite to this
great policy, than to fight and to render back the fruits of our
successes. We may be assured, that those with whom we contend
are ready enough to improve <em>their</em> victories. If we are not equally
so, <em>we shall never be at rest</em>. If the enemy beats us, he wins our
provinces.—[<em>What provinces of ours?</em>]—If we beat him, we restore
all. What more profitable game could he desire! Truly, at this
rate, our neighbours must be arrant fools if they leave us one week’s
repose!’</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a spirit of Machiavelian policy in this paragraph
which is very commendable. It reminds us of the satirist’s
description of ‘fools aspiring to be knaves.’ It is, in fact, this
fear of being outwitted by the French, that constantly makes us
the dupes of our suspicions of them, as it is a want of confidence
in our own strength or firmness, that leads us to shew our courage
by defiance. True courage, as well as true wisdom, is not distrustful
of itself. Vetus recommends it to us to act upon the
maxims of the common disturbers of mankind, of ‘this obdurate
and rapacious foe,’ as the only means to secure general tranquillity.
He wishes to embody the pretended spirit and principles
of French diplomacy in a code,—the acknowledged basis of
which should be either universal conquest, or endless hostility.
We have, it seems, no chance of repelling the aggressions of the
French, but by retaliating them not only on themselves, but on
other states. At least, the author gives a pretty broad hint of
what he means by the improvement of <em>our</em> victories, when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>talks of annexing Holland and Danish Zealand to Hanover, as
‘her natural prey,’ <em>instead</em> of their being the dependencies of
France. This is certainly one way of trimming the balance of
power in Europe, and placing the independence of nations in a
most happy dilemma. The inventor of this new and short way
with foreign states only laments that Hanover, ‘under British
auspices,’ has not been before-hand with France in imitating
Prussia in her seizure of the Austrian province on one side, and
her partition of Poland on the other. He can scarcely express
his astonishment and regret, that Holland and Denmark should
so long have escaped falling into our grasp, after the brilliant
example of ‘rapacity and obduracy’ set to our phlegmatic, plodding,
insipid, <em>commercial</em> spirit by Prussia and Russia. But now
that we have rescued ‘our natural prey’ from the French, it is to
be hoped, that we shall make sure of it. Vetus’s great principles of
morality seem to be borrowed from those of Peachum, and his
acknowledgements of merit to flow much in the same channel:—‘A
good clever lad, this Nimming Ned—there’s not a handier in the
whole gang, nor one more industrious to save goods from the fire!’—His
chief objection to that ‘revolutionist,’ Bonaparte, (Vetus too is
a projector of revolutions) is not, evidently, to his being a robber,
but because he is at the head of a different gang; and we are only
required to bestir ourselves as effectually as he does, <em>for the good of
mankind</em>! But Vetus, whose real defect is a contraction of intellectual
vision, sees no alternative between this rapacious and obdurate
policy, and unconditional submission, between ‘restoring all’ or none.
This is not sound logic. He wishes by a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup sur</span></i> to prevent an
unfair and dishonourable peace, by laying down such rules as must
make peace impossible, under any circumstances, or on any grounds
that can enter into human calculation. According to him, our
only security against the most wild and extravagant concessions,
is the obstinate determination to make none; our only defence
against the fascinations of our own folly, is to take refuge from
the exercise of our discretion in his impregnable paradoxes.—‘The
same argument which goes to justify a war, prescribes war
measures of the most determined and active character.’ Good;
because the nature and essence of war is <em>a trial of strength</em>; and,
therefore, to make it as advantageous to ourselves as possible, we
ought to exert all the strength that we possess. ‘The very object,’
continues Vetus, ‘that of weakening the enemy, for which we pursue
those vigorous measures, and strip him of his possessions, renders it
<em>necessary</em> to keep him in that state of weakness by which he will be
deterred from repeating his attack; and, <em>therefore, to hold inflexibly</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>what we have acquired.’ Here again Vetus confounds himself, and,
involving a plain principle in the mazes of a period, represents war
not as a trial of strength between contending states, each exerting
himself to the utmost, but as a voluntary assumption of superiority
on the part of one of them. He talks of stripping the enemy of his
possessions, and holding them inflexibly—as matters of course, as
questions of will, and not of power.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is neither the actual possession, nor <em>the will</em> to keep certain
acquisitions, but the <em>power</em> to keep them, and, <em>at the same time</em>,
to extort other concessions from an enemy, that must determine
the basis of all negociations, that are not founded on verbal chimeras.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘We are taught, indeed, to take for granted, that a peace, whose
conditions bear hard on either party, will be the sooner broken by
that party; and, therefore, that we have an indirect interest in
sacrificing a portion of our conquests.’ The general principle here
stated is self-evident, and one would think indisputable. For the
very ground of war is a peace whose conditions are thought to <em>bear
hard</em> on one of the parties, and yet, according to Vetus, the only way
to make peace durable, to prevent the recurrence of an appeal to force,
is to impose such hard conditions on an enemy, as it is his interest,
and must be his inclination, to break <em>by force</em>. An opinion of the
disproportion between our general strength, and our actual advantages,
seems to be the necessary ground of war, but it is here converted into
the permanent source of peace. The origin of the common prejudice
is, however, very satisfactorily illustrated in the remainder of the
paragraph. ‘This language is in favour with the two extremes of
English faction. The blind opponents of every minister <em>who happens
to be engaged in conducting a war</em>’ [<em>Is war then a mere affair of
accident?</em>] ‘can see no danger in national dishonour; and cry out for
peace with double vehemence, whenever it is least likely to be concluded
well. The dependents, on the other hand, of any feeble
government, will strive to lower the expectations of the country—to
exclaim against <em>immoderate</em> exertion—to depreciate her powers in war,
and her pretensions at a peace:—thus preparing an oblique defence
for their employers, and undermining the honest disappointment’
[<em>Quere expectations</em>] ‘of the people when they reflect how little has
been done by war, and how much’ [of that little] ‘undone by
negociation. But besides being a factious expedient, it is a principle
of action equally false and absurd. I deny that we affect any thing
more by granting an enemy what are <em>called favourable terms</em>, than
convince him that he may go to war with England, gratis. The
conditions he obtains will encourage him to try the chance of another
war, in the hope of a still more advantageous treaty.’ Here Vetus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>entirely shifts the state of the question. The terms of a peace, if <em>not
hard</em>, must be immediately <em>favourable</em>! Because we grant an enemy
such terms as he has a right to expect, it is made a conclusion that
we are also to grant him such as he has no right to expect, and which
will be so decidedly advantageous as to induce him to try his fortune
still farther against so generous an adversary. That is, Vetus has no
idea of the possibility of a just, fair, or honourable peace; his mind
refuses to dwell for a moment on any arrangement of terms, which,
by bearing hard on one party or another, will not be sure to end
speedily, from the desire on one side to retrieve its affairs, and on the
other to improve its advantages, in a renewal of war. ‘The only
valid security for peace is the accession to our own strength, and the
diminution of our rival’s, by the resources and dominions we have
wrested from him.’ First, this security can be good only on one
side: secondly, it is not good at all: the only security for peace is
not in the actual losses or distresses incurred by states, but in the
settled conviction that they cannot <em>better</em> themselves by war. But
all these contradictions are nothing to Vetus, who alone does not
fluctuate between the extremes of faction, but is still true to war—and
himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there is, in our opinion, a third extreme of English faction (if
Vetus will spare us the anomaly) not less absurd, and more mischievous
than either of the others: we mean those who are the blind
adherents of every minister who happens to be engaged in a war,
however unnecessarily or wantonly it may have been begun, or however
weakly and wickedly carried on: who see no danger in repeated
disgraces, and impending ruin, provided we are obstinately bent on
pursuing the same dreadful career which has led to them; who, when
our losses come thronging in upon us, urge us to persist till we recover
the advantages we have lost, and, when we recover them, force us on
till we lose all again: with whom peace, in a time of adverse fortune,
is dishonour, and in the pride of success, madness: who only exaggerate
‘our pretensions at a peace,’ that they may never be complied
with: who assume a settled unrelenting purpose in our adversary to
destroy us, in order to inspire us with the same principle of never-ending
hostility against him: who leave us no alternative but eternal
war, or inevitable ruin: who irritate the hatred and the fears of both
parties, by spreading abroad incessantly a spirit of defiance, suspicion,
and the most galling contempt: who, adapting every aspect of affairs
to their own purposes, constantly return in the same circle to the
point from which they set out: with whom peace is always unattainable,
war always necessary!</p>

<p class='c010'>We shall pass over Vetus’s historic researches, the wars of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Romans and Carthaginians (the formal latitude of Vetus’s pen delights
in these great divisions of human affairs), and come to what is more
to our purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>In modern times he first comes to the treaty of 1763, only (as far
as we can find) to affix the epithet ‘American rebels’ as a sort of
Pragmatic Sanction to our colonists, with whom, he says, France
joined a few years afterwards, and, ‘in spite of her ruined finances
and her peaceful king, aimed a mortal blow at the British monarchy.’
Yet, notwithstanding this long-standing and inveterate animosity of the
French court to this country, we find the same France, in the next
paragraph but one, stigmatized as <em>republican</em> and <em>Corsican</em>, ‘with centric
and eccentric scribbled o’er,’ as if these were important distinctions,
though Vetus himself ‘would prefer for France the scourge of
Bonaparte, to the <em>healthier</em>, and to England <em>not less hostile</em>, sovereignty
of the banished house of Bourbon.’ Why then pertinaciously affix
these obnoxious epithets? They are bad ornaments of style—they
are worse interpreters of truth.</p>

<p class='c010'>To prove his general axiom, that in order to be stable, ‘the
conditions of peace must bear hard on one of the parties,’ Vetus asks,
‘Were the powers that partitioned unhappy Poland so conciliated by
her acquiescence in their first encroachments, as to abstain from offering
her any second wrong?’ Now this is an instance precisely in
point to prove the direct reverse of Vetus’s doctrine: for here was a
treaty in which the terms bore exceedingly hard on one of the parties,
and yet this only led to accumulated wrongs by a renewal of war.
We say that hard conditions of peace, in all cases, will lead to a
rupture. If the parties are nearly equal, they will lead to resistance
to unfounded claims; if quite unequal—to an aggravation of oppression.
But would Russia and Prussia have been more lenient or deterred
from their encroachments, if Poland had pretended to impose hard
conditions of peace on them? These governments partitioned
Poland, not in consequence of any treaty good or bad, but because
they had the will and the power to do so. Vetus would terrify
the French into moderation by hard conditions of peace, and yet he
supposes us to be in the same relation to France as Poland to its
implacable enemies.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Did the wretched complaisance of the leading continental courts
in their several treaties with France, ensure their tranquillity even
for a moment?’ This is still altering the record. The question is
not about submitting to hard conditions, but about imposing them.
Besides, ‘the aggravated and multiplied molestations, injuries, and
insults, which these courts were doomed to suffer,’ might be accounted
for from those which they had in vain attempted to inflict on France,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>and from their still more wretched complaisance in being made the
tools of a court which was not continental.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Then comes the peace of Amiens, our peace of Amiens—a peace
born, educated, nourished, and matured in this very philanthropic
spirit of gentleness and forgiveness. In the war which preceded <em>the
truce</em> of which I am speaking, <em>the French government</em> involved <em>us</em> in
considerably more than two hundred millions of debt.’ Vetus then
proceeds to state that we made peace without any liquidation of this
claim, without satisfaction, without a bond, (<em>what else?</em>) without a
promise, without a single guinea! ‘I will have ransom, most egregious
ransom.’ Why was it ever heard of that one government paid the
debts in which another had involved itself in making war upon it?</p>

<p class='c010'>‘The language of England,’ says our author, ‘was correctly what
follows:—You, Monsieur, have loaded <em>me</em> with unspeakable distresses
and embarrassments,’ (<em>all this while, be it recollected, our affairs were
going on most prosperously and gloriously in the cant of The Times</em>) ‘you
have robbed me of half my fortune, and reduced me to the brink of
beggary,’ (<em>the French by all accounts were in the gulph of bankruptcy</em>)
‘you have torn away and made slaves of my friends and kindred,’
(<em>indeed</em>) ‘you have dangerously wounded me, and murdered my
beloved children, who armed to defend their parent.’—This is too
much, even for the dupes of England. Stick, Vetus, to your statistics,
and do not make the pathetic ridiculous! Sophistry and affectation
may confound common sense to a certain degree, but there is a point
at which our feelings revolt against them.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have already remarked on what Vetus says of Hanover; he
probably will not wish us to go farther into it. Of Bonaparte he
says, of course, that nothing short of unconditional submission will
ever satisfy that revolutionist, and that he will convert the smallest
concession made to him into a weapon for our destruction. That is,
we have it in our power to set him at defiance, to insult him, to
‘bring him to the block,’ etc., whenever we please; and yet we are
so completely in his power, so dependent on him, that the smallest
concession must be fatal to us, will be made the instrument of our
inevitable destruction. Thus is the public mind agitated and distracted
by incredible contradictions, and made to feel at once ‘the
fierce extremes’ of terror and triumph, of rashness and despair.
‘Our safety lies in his weakness, not in his will.’ If so, or if it
depends on either of the conditions here stated, we are in no very
pleasant situation. But our real safety depends on our own strength,
and steady reliance on it, and not on the arguments of Vetus.</p>

<p class='c013'>The last Letter of Vetus begins with an allusion to the events which
have lately taken place in Holland. He then proceeds—‘What final
effect this popular movement by the Dutch may have upon the future
interests and prosperity of England is a question to be discussed with
deliberate caution—with extreme solicitude—and with the chance, I
trust, the distant chance, of its conducting us to no very gratifying
conclusion!’ There is something in this passage truly characteristic,
and well worthy of our notice. Vetus is, it seems, already jealous of
the Dutch. The subtle venom of his officious zeal is instantly put in
motion by the prospect of their national independence and commercial
prosperity; and his pen is, no doubt, prepared, on the slightest provocation
of circumstances, to convert them from an ally to be saved,
into a rival and an enemy to be crushed. He, however, waives for
the present the solemn discussion, till he can find some farther
grounds to confirm him in his extreme solicitude and mysterious
apprehensions. The perverse readiness of Vetus to pick a quarrel
out of everything, or out of nothing, is exactly described in Spenser’s
Allegory of <cite>Furor</cite> and <cite>Occasion</cite>, which if we thought him ‘made of
penetrable stuff,’ we would recommend to his perusal.</p>

<p class='c010'>The introductory comment on the Revolution in Holland is a clue
to the whole of our author’s political system, which we shall here
endeavour to explain. He looks askance with ‘leer malign’ on the
remotest prospect of good to other nations. Every addition to the
general stock of liberty or happiness, is to him so much taken from
our own. He sees nothing gratifying in that prosperity or independence,
which is shared (or any part of it) with foreign nations. He
trembles with needless apprehension at the advantages in store for
them, which he anticipates only to prevent, and is indifferent to our
own welfare, interests, honour—except as they result from the
privations, distress, and degradation of the rest of the world. Hatred,
suspicion, and contempt for other nations are the first and last
principles of the love which ‘an upright Englishman’ bears to his
country. To prevent their enjoying a moment’s repose, or indulging
even in a dream of future comfort, he would involve his own country
in incessant distraction and wretchedness, and risk its final ruin on
the cast of a die!—Vetus professes, with some reason, not to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>enamoured of quotation: but he may, perhaps, allow us to refer to
an author, who, though not so deep read in Vattel and the writings of
the jurists, had just and penetrating views of human nature. ‘Think,
there’s livers out of England. What’s England in the world’s
map? In a great pool a swan’s nest.’ Now this ‘swan’s nest’ is
indeed to us more than all the world besides—to cherish, to protect,
to love, and honour it. But if we expect it to be so to the rest of
the world—if we do not allow them to cultivate their own affections,
to improve their own advantages, to respect their own rights, to maintain
their own independence—if in the blindness of our ignorance,
our pride, and our presumption, we think of setting up our partial and
local attachments as the law of nature and nations—if we practise, or
so much as tolerate in theory that ‘exclusive patriotism’ which is
inconsistent with the common privileges of humanity, and attempt to
dictate our individual caprices, as paramount and binding obligations
on those, to whose exaction of the same claims from us we should
return only loud scorn, indignation, and defiance—if we are ever so
lost to reason, as Vetus would have us, who supposes that we cannot
serve our country truly and faithfully but by making others the vassals
of her avarice or insolence; we shall then indeed richly deserve, if
we do not meet with, the natural punishment of such disgraceful and
drivelling hypocrisy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vetus, who is extremely dissatisfied with our application of the
term ‘exclusive patriotism’ to him, is nevertheless ‘at a loss to
understand the patriotism which is not exclusive. The word <em>implies</em>
a preference of the rights and welfare of our own country to those of
other (and above all other) of rival countries. This is not indeed
the philanthropy of Anacharsis Cloots—it is not the dreary jargon of
metaphysics, nor the shop-boy philosophy of a printer’s devil—nor the
<em>sans-culotterie</em> of scholastic virtue.’ We will tell Vetus what we mean
by exclusive patriotism, such as (we say) his is. We mean by it
then, not that patriotism which implies a preference of the rights and
welfare of our own country, but that which professes to annihilate
and proscribe the rights of others—not that patriotism which supposes
us to be the creatures of circumstance, habit, and affection, but that
which divests us of the character of reasonable beings—which fantastically
makes our interests or prejudices the sole measure of right and
wrong to other nations, and constitutes us sole arbiters of the empire
of the world—in short, which, under the affectation of an overweening
anxiety for the welfare of our own country, <em>excludes</em> even the shadow
of a pretension to common sense, justice, and humanity. It is this
wretched solecism which Vetus would fain bolster up into a system,
with all the logic and rhetoric he is master of. It is true, this kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>of patriotism is not the philanthropy of Anacharsis Cloots; it has
nothing to do with philanthropy in any shape, but it is a vile compound
of ‘the jargon of metaphysics, with the vulgar notions of a
printer’s devil.’ It is an intense union of the grossness and narrowness
of ignorance with the dangerous refinement of the most abstracted
speculation. It is passion and prejudice, inflamed by philosophy,
and philosophy distorted by passion and prejudice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alter his cold exordium on the Revolution in Holland, our consistent
politician enters with warmth on Lord Castlereagh’s speech on
the subsidiary treaties, in which he finds a <em>But</em> before the word <em>Peace</em>,
which has a most happy efficacy in healing the wounds inflicted on
his tortured apprehensions, by the explicit, unqualified declaration of
Lord Liverpool in the other House. ‘After describing the laudable
solicitude of Ministers for the attainment of that <em>first</em> of earthly goods,
peace,’ (we thought it had ranked last in the mind of Vetus) ‘his
Lordship added <em>what was worth all the rest</em>—BUT we must have a
<em>secure</em> peace. We must not only recollect with whom we contend,
but with whom we negociate, and never grant to <em>such</em> an enemy
conditions, which under the name of peace, would disarm this nation,
and expose her to <em>contingent</em> dangers.’ (To place any nation out of
the reach of contingent dangers in peace or war is, we imagine, an
undertaking beyond even the <em>calibre</em> of Lord Castlereagh’s talents as
a statesman.) ‘These,’ proceeds Vetus, ‘were nearly the words;
they certainly do not compromise his meaning.’ (Our author cannot
be much mistaken in attributing to his Lordship any words which
seeming to have some meaning, in reality have none.) ’ Here then
the noble Secretary has <em>chased away every doubtful expression</em> of his
colleague.’ (‘Why so,—this horrible shadow’ of peace ‘being
gone,’ Vetus ‘is himself again.’)</p>

<p class='c010'>‘The sentiment delivered by the sovereign on the throne is now
given to us with a construction, at which we need no longer be
alarmed. <em>I</em> ask only that <em>secure</em> peace,—a peace consistent with
English safety—<em>void of the shadow of regard or indulgence to the
pretensions and honour, otherwise the ambition and arrogance of Bonaparte</em>,
which, as compared with <em>the relief of one day’s hunger to the meanest
peasant in this our native land</em>, are baubles not worth a name!’—This
is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable specimens we ever met
with of that figure in rhetoric, designated by an excellent writer as
‘the figure of <em>encroachment</em>.’<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Vetus, by a series of equations
(certainly not mathematical ones) at length arrives at a construction
of peace at which he is no longer alarmed; at the identical peace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>which he wants, and the only one he will admit,—a peace preposterous
in its very terms, and in its nature impracticable,—a peace ‘void of
the shadow of regard or indulgence to the pretensions and honour’ of
the enemy, which are to pass with them as well as with us, for so
much ‘arrogance and ambition.’ This is the only peace consistent
with English safety—this is the secure peace of Lord Castlereagh—the
fair and honourable peace announced from the throne—the very
peace which Lord Liverpool meant to describe when he startled
Vetus by the doubtful expression of a peace ‘consistent with the
honour, rights, and interests of France’—‘of such a peace as we in
her situation should be disposed to grant.’ To the mind of Vetus,
which is indeed the very receptacle for contradictions ‘to knot and
gender in,’ these two sorts of peace appear to be perfectly compatible,
and the one a most happy explanation of the other, viz. a peace void
of every shadow of regard to the rights and honour of a rival nation,
and a peace consistent with those rights and that honour. If this is not
‘mere midsummer madness,’ we do not know what is. Or if any thing
can surpass it (‘for in this lowest deep of absurdity a lower deep still
opens to receive us, gaping wide’) it is the forlorn piece of sentimental
mummery by which it is attempted to protract this endless war of
proscription against the pretensions of France, under the mask of
relieving the wants and distresses of the meanest peasant of this our
native land! Compared with the tears and blood of our countrymen,
all the sophistries of Vetus by which he would make them victims of
his own vanity and egotism, not less than of the arrogance and
ambition of Bonaparte, are indeed contemptible and mischievous
baubles.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What means the impious cry raised by degenerate Englishmen
against the mere chance—nay, the remotest possibility of a peace,
whose terms should be honourable to their country? Whence arises
this profligate and abandoned yell with which these traitors insult us?
<em>Are they still in pay? Is their patron still rich enough to bribe them?</em>
When we demand compensation for our <em>dreadful sufferings</em>, it is but
what justice grants. When we call for security, it is what our
existence requires. Yet, when these undoubted rights and essential
safeguards of an injured people are asserted, it is nothing less than
blaspheming the holy supremacy of Bonaparte!’</p>

<p class='c010'>First, when Vetus demands compensation for our sufferings, it
would perhaps hardly be sufficient to refer him to the satisfaction
which the patriotic contributors to <cite>The Times</cite>, <cite>The Courier</cite>, <cite>The
Morning Post</cite>, <cite>The Sun</cite>, and <cite>The Star</cite>, must have had in writing, and
their admirers in reading the daily paragraphs, of which those sufferings
were the dreadful price, and the inevitable result. When we demand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>compensation for what we have suffered, it is but <em>justice</em>, if we can at
the same time make compensation for what we have made others
suffer; but at all events, it is no compensation for past sufferings, to
make them perpetual. When we call for security, we are right; but
when we tell the enemy that our only security is in his destruction,
and call upon him for this pledge and safeguard of our undoubted
rights, we shew, by asking for what we know we cannot have, that
not security, but defiance is our object. As to the terms of abuse
which are introduced in this paragraph (we suppose, to vary the
general gravity and decorum of Vetus’s style) we shall answer them
by a very short statement of what we conceive to be the truth.
Europe has been for the last twenty years engaged in a desperate and
(for some reason or other) an unequal struggle against France;—by
playing at double or quits, she has just recovered from the very brink
of destruction; and the keepers of our political E.O. tables treat us
as traitors and miscreants, who would dissuade her from sitting down
once more to finish the game, and ruin her adversary.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘—It is asked,—“Do we propose to humble France? Do we
propose to destroy her? If so, we breathe <em>eternal</em> war; if so, we
convert the aggressor into the sufferer, and transfer all the dignity
and authority of justice to the enemy against whom we arm!”’ Yes,
against whom we arm for the avowed purpose of his destruction.
From the moment that we make the destruction of an enemy (be he
who he may) the indispensable condition of our safety, our destruction
from that moment <em>becomes</em> necessary to his, and an act of self-defence.
Not much liking this dilemma from which our author has more than
once ‘struggled to get free,’ he in the next passage makes a wide
career indeed, in order, no doubt, to return to the charge with better
effect hereafter. ‘The question of peace or eternal war is not a <em>naked
question</em> of right and wrong. It is a question, whose morality is
determined by its reference to our preservation as a people. To
such interrogatories I answer without reserve, that we ought to exact
<em>precisely</em> that measure of humiliation from France, and that we do
recommend <em>that critical advance towards her destruction</em>, that may
combine the utmost <em>attainable</em> satisfaction for our past grievances with
a solid protection to our future interest and welfare. From France,
since the <em>fatal</em> battle of Hastings, what has <em>this nation of Saxon
warriors</em>’—(We hardly know ourselves in the learned livery of
Vetus’s style. He himself is doubtless descended from some very
old family settled here before the Conquest)—‘What has this nation
of Saxon warriors ever yet endured from France but injury and
affliction?’ Yet we have made a shift to exist as a nation under all
this load of calamity. We still breathe and live notwithstanding some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>intervals of repose, some short resting places afforded us, before this
morbid inspector of health, like another Doctor Pedro Positive,
injoined his preposterous regimen of incessant war as necessary to
lasting peace, and to our preservation as a people!</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Modern France’ continues Vetus, rising in his argument, has no
principle so deeply rooted as that of everlasting enmity to England.
‘I confess for this reason that in my uncorrupted judgment <em>the best
security</em> for Great Britain, and therefore, <em>if practicable, her most imperious
duty</em>, would be <em>the absolute conquest of France</em>. But since that,
<em>unfortunately</em>, is an event which <em>at present</em> we are not likely to
accomplish, <em>the second best security</em> is’ (one would think not to attempt
it at all; no, but) ‘to reduce her, <em>if we can</em>, to a degree of weakness
consistent <em>with our immediate repose</em>.’ After thus modestly postponing
the absolute conquest of France to a more convenient opportunity, he
adds the following incredible sentence. ‘If the enemy should be so
far borne away by <em>his hatred</em>, as to command <em>his emissaries</em> in London
to announce that he prefers waging eternal war to the acceptance of
conditions, which <em>his own persevering and atrocious outrages</em> have
rendered in the mind of every Englishman indispensable to the safety
of these islands, the woeful alternative of perpetual war very plainly
originates not with Great Britain but with Bonaparte!’ That is to
say, <cite>The Times</cite> not long ago laid it down as a fixed, unalterable
maxim, without reference to terms of one sort or another, that we
were never to make peace with Bonaparte; Vetus in this very letter
enters into an elaborate apology, for that multitude of wise, honest,
and virtuous persons who think his existence as a sovereign <em>at all times</em>
threatens our existence as a nation, and it is because we entered our
protest against this ‘frantic outcry raised by degenerate Englishmen,’
that Bonaparte is here made to charge his emissaries in London to
announce that he prefers eternal war to the acceptance of conditions,
the moderation of which conditions or of <em>our second best security</em>
may be judged of when we are told that the best, and indeed only
real security for Great Britain, and therefore her most imperious duty,
would be the absolute conquest of France. Vetus is, however,
contented with such terms of peace as will imply only a <em>critical
advance to her destruction</em>, and if Bonaparte is not contented with the
same terms, the alternative of eternal war, it seems, originates with him
and not with Vetus.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>But we deny that though this best security for Great Britain, the
absolute conquest of France, were in her power, that it would be her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>most imperious duty to effect it. And we deny it, because on the
same ground a better security still for Great Britain would be the
conquest or destruction of Europe and the world; and yet we do not
think it her imperious duty, even if she could, to accomplish the one,
or to make a <em>critical</em> advance to the other. For if it is once laid
down and acted upon as a maxim in national morality, that the best
and most desirable security of a state is in the destruction of its
neighbours, or that there is to be an unrelenting ever watchful critical
approximation to this object as far as possible, there is an end of civil
society. The same principle of not stopping short of this <em>maximum</em> of
selfish security will impose the same imperious duty of rankling
jealousy, and inexorable hostility on others. Our speculator’s ‘best
possible security’ for the independence of states, is nothing but a
watchword for mutual havoc, and wide-spreading desolation. Terrified
with the phantom of imaginary danger, he would have us rush headlong
on the reality. We are obstinately to refuse the enjoyment of a
moment’s repose, and proceed to commit wilful dilapidation on the
estate of our happiness, because it is not secured to us by an everlasting
tenure. Placed at the mercy of the malice or hypocrisy of every
venal alarmist, our only resource must be to seek a refuge from our
fears in our own destruction, or to find the gratification of our revenge
in that of others. But a whole nation is no more justified in obtaining
this best of all possible securities for itself, by the immediate subversion
of other states, than the assassin is justified in taking the life of another,
to prevent the possibility of any future attempt upon his own. For
in proportion as a state is weak and incapable of subjugating us, is the
manifest injustice of any such precaution;—and in proportion as a
state is formidable, and likely to excite serious apprehension for our
own safety, is the danger and folly of setting an example which may
be retaliated with so much greater effect, and ‘like a devilish engine,
recoil upon ourselves.’ That exclusive patriotism which claims for
our country an exemption from ‘contingent danger,’ which would
place its wealth, its power, or even its safety beyond the reach of
chance and the fluctuation of human affairs, claims for it an exemption
from the common lot of human nature. That exclusive patriotism
which seeks to enforce this claim (equally impious and unwise) by the
absolute conquest of rival states, tempts the very ruin it professes to
avert.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Vetus mistakes the nature of patriotism altogether. He
would transform that principle which was intended for the tutelary
genius of nations, into the destroying demon of the world. He
ransacks past history to revive old grudges; he anticipates the future
to invent new ones. In his whole system, there is not room for ‘so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>small a drop of pity as a wren’s eye.’ His patriotism is the worm
that dies not; a viper gnawing at the heart. He would strip this
feeling of everything but the low cunning, and brutal ferocity of the
savage state, and then arm it with all the refinements of scholastic
virtue, and the most rigid logic. The diverging rays of human reason
which should be diffused to cheer and enlighten the moral world, are
in him collected into a focus of raging zeal to burn and destroy. It is
well for mankind that in the order of the universe, our passions
naturally circumscribe themselves, and contain their own antidote
within them. The only justification of our narrow, selfish passions,
is their short-sightedness:—were it not for this, the jealousies of
individuals and of nations would not leave them the smallest interval
of rest. It is well that the ungovernable impulses of fear and hatred
are excited only by gross, palpable objects; and are therefore transient,
and limited in their operation. It is well that those motives which
do not owe their birth to reason, should not afterwards receive their
nourishment and support from it. If in their present desultory state,
they produce so many mischiefs, what would be the case, if they were
to be organized into systems, and elevated into abstract principles of
right and wrong?</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole of Vetus’s reasoning is founded on the false notions of
patriotism which we have here pointed out, and which we conceive to
be totally inconsistent with ‘the just principles of negociation.’ The
remainder of his letter, which unfolds his motives for a pacific
arrangement with Bonaparte, is founded entirely on the same jaundiced
and distempered views. Many wise, many honest, many virtuous
persons, he says, have maintained, not without reason, ‘the incompetency
of <em>this Corsican</em> under any circumstances to discharge the
obligations of a state of peace.’ But he, more wise, more honest,
more virtuous, sees a hope, a shadow of peace, rising like a cloudy
speck out of a quarter where it was least expected. ‘The stone
which the builders rejected, is become the corner-stone of his Temple
of Peace.’—‘It does not appear to Vetus, that a peace with Bonaparte
is now unattainable on terms sufficient for our safety.’ He thinks
there is no man so proper to make peace with as this Corsican, this
Revolutionist,—no one so proper to govern France—to the complete
exclusion of the Bourbons, whose pretensions he scouts analytically,
logically, and chronologically, and who, it seems, had always the
same implacable animosity against this country as Bonaparte, <em>without
a tythe of his ability</em>. [Surely this circumstance might plead a little
in their favour with Vetus.] And why so? Whence arises this
unexpected partiality shewn to Bonaparte? Why it is ‘from the
strong conviction that by no other means so decisive as the existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>of this man, with his consuming, depressing and degrading system of
government, can we hope to see France <em>crushed and ground down
below the capacity of contending for ages to come</em> with the force of the
British Empire, <em>moved by the spirit of freedom</em>! Regarding France
under every known form of government as the irreconcileable foe
of England, <em>I have beheld with almost unmingled joy the growth and
accumulation of this savage despotism</em>!’ To be sure ‘while there
appeared to some persons,’ [Vetus was not one of them] ‘a <em>chance</em>
of his enslaving the Continent, and hurling the mass of subjugated
nations against our shores—then, indeed, those who entertained such
fears were justified in seeking his <em>personal</em> and political destruction.
But once released from the terror of his arm, <em>what genuine Englishman</em>
can fail to rejoice in the privilege of consigning Bonaparte and the
French people, for better for worse, to the paradise of each other’s
embraces?’ Vetus then proceeds to inveigh at great length against
the persons and pretensions of the Bourbons. Leaving them to the
mercy of this good-natured remembrancer, we shall only observe, that
he decides the impolicy of restoring the Bourbons, by asking, whether
their restoration would not be advantageous to France, and consequently
(he infers very consistently with himself) <em>injurious to this
country</em>. Looking forward but half a century, he sees France gradually
regain under the old regime ‘her natural ascendancy over Great
Britain, from which she falls, and must fall every hour more rapidly
from the necessary operation of those principles on which the Corsican
dynasty is founded.’ Nay, looking on farther than the expiration of
the same half century, he sees ‘sloth, weakness, and poverty, worse
than ever sprung from Turkish policy, proceeding from this odious,
self-dissolving power, and a gulph of irretrievable destruction, already
yawning for our eternal foe.’</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not long ago since Vetus drew an historical parallel between
this country and Carthage, encouraging us to expect the same fate
from France which Carthage received from Rome, and to act upon
this fanciful comparison as a solid ground of wisdom. Now all at
once ‘this mendicant in argument, this perfect juggler in politics,’
inverts the perspective, takes a prophetic view of the events of the
next fifty years, and France is seen dwindling into another Turkey,
which the genius of British freedom grinds to powder, and crushes
beneath her feet! These great statesmen-like views of things, ‘this
large discourse of reason, looking before and after,’ are, we confess,
beyond us. We recollect indeed a similar prophecy to that of Vetus,
couched in nearly the same terms, when in the year 1797, the French
were said to be ‘on the verge, nay, in the very gulph of bankruptcy,’
and that their finances could not hold out six months longer. Vetus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>however, taught by the failure of past prognostics, constructs his
political calculations for the ensuing century, instead of the ensuing
year, and puts off the day of reckoning to a period when he and his
predictions will be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such are the charitable grounds on which our author wishes to
secure Bonaparte on the throne of France, and thinks that peace may
at present be made with him, on terms consistent with our safety.
He is not, like others, ‘ready to shake hands with the Usurper over
the tomb of the murdered D’Enghien, provided he will <em>return to the
paths of religion and virtue</em>;’ but he will shake hands with him over
the ruins of the liberty and happiness of France, on the express condition
that ‘he never returns to the paths of religion and morality.’
Vetus is willing to forget the injuries which Bonaparte may have done
to England, for the sake of the greater mischiefs he may do to
France. These are the ‘obligations’ which Vetus owes to him—this
the source of his gratitude, the sacred pledge that reconciles him
to ‘that monster whom England detests.’ He is for making peace
with the ‘tyrant,’ to give him an opportunity to rivet on the chains of
France, and fix her final doom. But is Vetus sincere in all this?
His reasoning comes in a very questionable shape; and we the more
doubt it, because he has no sooner (under the auspices of Bonaparte)
hurled France down the gulf of irretrievable destruction, than he
immediately resumes the old topic of eternal war or perpetual
bondage, as the only alternative which this country can look to.
Why, if he is in earnest, insist with Lord Castlereagh on the caution
with which we must grant terms to ‘such an enemy,’ to this disabled
and paralyzed foe? Why assert, as Vetus did in his very last letter,
that ‘nothing short of unconditional submission will ever satisfy that
revolutionist, and that any concession made to him will be instantly
converted into a weapon for our destruction?’ Why not grant to
him such terms as might be granted to the Bourbons, since they
would be granted to a much less dangerous and powerful rival?
Why not subsist, as we have hitherto done, without the fear of
perpetual war or perpetual bondage before our eyes, now that the
crown of France has lost its original brightness, and is shorn of those
beams which would again sparkle round it, if fixed on the head of a
Bourbon? We suspect that our author is not quite in earnest in his
professions, because he is not consistent with himself. Is it possible
that his anxiety to keep out the Bourbons arises from his fear that
peace might creep in with them, at least as a sort of compliment of
the season? Is our veteran politician aware, in his own mind, that
the single epithets, Corsican, republican, revolutionary, will have
more effect in stirring up the embers of war, than all the arguments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>which he might use to demonstrate the accumulating dangers to be
apprehended from the mild paternal sway of the ancient dynasty?</p>

<p class='c010'>We cannot help saying, however, that we think the elaborate
attempt of Vetus to prove the necessary extinction of the power of
France under the government of Bonaparte, a total failure. What is
the amount of his argument? That in a period when the French
were to owe their existence and their power to war, Bonaparte has
made them a warlike people, and that they did not sit down quietly
to ‘the cultivation of arts, luxuries, and letters,’ when the world was
beleaguered against them. Is it for Vetus, who reprobates the peace
of Amiens, <em>that hollow truce</em> (as he justly calls it), that intermission
of war but for a moment, to say of Bonaparte, ‘His application of
public industry is only to the arts of death—all other perishes for
want of wholesome nourishment’? What then becomes of the long-resounded
charge against him on his exclamation ‘for ships, colonies,
and commerce’? We suspect, that energy in war is not an absolute
proof of weakness in peace. He lays down, indeed, a general
principle (true enough in itself) that a government, in its nature and
character at variance with the people, must be comparatively weak
and insecure; yet, in applying this maxim, he proves not that the
French people and government are at irreconcileable variance, but
that the one has become entirely subdued and assimilated to the other.
But hear him speak for himself. ‘The causes of the overthrow of
the old government are foreign to our present purpose. The consequence
has been the birth of <em>this bloody and scorching despotism</em>,—this
giant, armed from his mother’s womb with sweeping scimitar and
consuming fire. Can such a government be fit for such a people?
Can a tyranny, operating by direct violence and characteristic of the
earliest periods in the most barbarous condition of mankind, have any
quality adapted to the wants or feelings of a nation, grown <em>old in arts</em>,
luxuries, and letters? Is it not plain to the least acute observer, that
where the principles of such a government, and such a stage of society,
are so vehemently contrasted, there can be no immediate alliance;
but that an incessant counteraction must ensue—that the government
or the people must change their character before a just harmony and
co-operation can exist between them; <em>in other words, that one of them
must yield</em>!’</p>

<p class='c010'>[Well, this is the very thing which, in the next sentence, he shews
has actually taken place.] ‘And <em>from whom</em> are we to infer this
ultimate submission to its rival? Has the tyrant loosed his chains?—has
he relaxed his hold, or flung aside the whip of scorpions? No!
it is <em>France herself which has given way</em>. It is the French nation
who gradually recede from the rest of the civilized world.’ That is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>it is France who, contrary to Vetus’s argument, in receding gradually
from the rest of the civilized world, has been identified with the
government, and become that whip of scorpions in the hands of
Bonaparte, which has been the scourge and dread of all Europe. It
is thus that our author always defeats himself. He is fond of abstruse
reasoning and deep investigation in exact proportion to his incapacity
for them—as eunuchs are amorous through impotence!</p>

<p class='c010'>But though he fails in his argument, the moral is not less instructive.
He teaches us on what grounds a genuine English patriot goes to
war, and on what terms he will make peace. A patriot of this
exclusive stamp, who is troubled with none of the symptoms of a
‘spurious and mawkish beneficence,’ threatens France with the
restoration of the Bourbons, only to throw her into the convulsions of
anarchy, and withdraws that kindly interference, only that she may
sink into the more fatal lethargy of despotism. It is the same consistent
patriot who kindles the fires of La Vendée, and whenever it
suits his purpose, is no longer borne away by the ‘torrent of royal,
flaming, unreflecting sympathies!’ It is the same tried friend of his
country, who carries on a twenty years’ war for the preservation of
our trade and manufactures, and when they are mentioned as
inducements for peace, disdains ‘all gross, commercial calculations.’
It is the same conscientious politician, who at one time makes war
for the support of social order, and the defence of our holy religion;—who,
at another, hails the disappearance of ‘the last glimmering of
education among a people grown old in arts and letters,’ and who
rejoices ‘to see the Christian religion made studiously contemptible
by the poverty and debasement of its professors!’ It is the same
true patriot, the same Vetus, who ‘beholds with unmingled joy, the
growth and accumulation of a savage despotism, which is to crush and
bow down France under our feet;’—who holds ‘the whip of
scorpions over her head;’—who ‘arms a scorching tyranny with
sweeping scimitar and consuming fire’ against her;—who pushes her
headlong down ‘the yawning gulf of irretrievable destruction;’ it is
the same Vetus, who, suddenly recovering all the severity of justice,
and all the tenderness of humanity, makes a piteous outcry about ‘the
dreadful sufferings we have endured,’ in attempting to heap coals of
fire on our adversary, demands the payment of ‘two hundred millions
of debt, in which her government have wantonly involved us,’
complains of our being ‘driven to beggary and want’ in this unnatural
conflict, calls for the release of our countrymen, ‘sent into hopeless
captivity,’ and invokes the murdered names of those children of the
state, who ‘armed to defend a beloved parent, and an injured
country!’ Even Vetus shrinks from the enormity of such inconsistencies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and excuses himself by saying, ‘Do I feel the spontaneous
and unprovoked desire that such a mass of evil should be perpetuated
for any portion of mankind? <em>God forbid.</em> But it is, <em>I conscientiously</em>
believe, a question, <em>which of these countries shall destroy the other</em>.
In that case, my part is taken—France must be ruined, to save our
native country from being ruined. If this be perpetual war, I cannot
help it. <em>Perpetual war has little terror, when perpetual bondage
threatens us.</em>’ Here then our bane and antidote are both before us:
perpetual war or perpetual bondage;—a pleasant alternative!—but it
is an alternative of Vetus’s making, and we shall not, <em>if we can help
it</em>, submit to either of his indispensable conditions. We shall not
learn of him, for ‘his yoke is not easy, nor his burden light.’ If
this be our inevitable lot, ‘he cannot help it.’ No; but he can help
laying the blame of his own irritable and mischievous conclusions on
Nature and Providence; or at least we think it our duty to guard
ourselves and others against the fatal delusion.</p>

<p class='c013'>We undertook, some time ago, the task of ascertaining the true
value of this writer’s reasoning, by removing the cumbrous load of
words which oppress his understanding, as well as that of his readers;
and we find that ‘our occupation is not yet gone.’ His last letter,
indeed, furnishes us with comparatively slender materials. His
style is considerably abated. With Bottom in the play, he may be
said to ‘aggravate his voice so, that he roars you an ’twere any
sucking dove.’ His swaggering paradoxes dwindle into unmeaning
common-places; his violent dogmas into tame equivocations. There
is scarcely an attempt made to defend his own extreme opinions, or to
repel the charge of gross and glaring inconsistency which we brought
against them. He makes indeed a faint effort to screen certain
general positions from the odium and contempt they deserve, by
explaining them away, and to shift off the responsibility of others, by
directly denying them. Vetus has, in fact, marched boldly on in a
fog of splendid words, till he unexpectedly finds himself on the edge
of a precipice, and he seems willing to retreat from it as well as his
accustomed solemnity, and the incumbrances of his style will permit.
It may, perhaps, be some consolation, if we remind him that he is not
the first enthusiast on record, who mistook a cloud for a goddess.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>His present situation is certainly no very pleasant one: it a good
deal resembles that of Parolles, when he undertook the recovery of
his drum.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most striking part of Vetus’s last letter is his gratuitous <em>tirade</em>
against what has been called the modern philosophy, as if this were
the only alternative (whereas it is in truth the antithesis or converse)
of his system of exclusive patriotism. Our contradiction of his first
principle, that the basis of a peace with France is to be one which
does not leave a shadow of regard to her honour, rights, or interest,
and that the terms of peace to which she is in duty bound to accede,
must be such as to imply a <em>critical advance</em> to her destruction—our
utter rejection of this new-fangled theory of negociation he considers
as ‘a sucker from the root of that poisonous vegetable, the doctrine of
universal benevolence,’ and deprecates our reasoning on the subject as
‘a blossom which threatens the desolation of the moral world!’
We really cannot attribute to our opinions any such power or any
such tendency as the morbid imagination of our political hypochondriac
lends to them. The arguments of Vetus on this question seem a
sort of transcript of Dr. Parr’s Spital Sermon, or of one of Sir
James Mackintosh’s lectures at Lincoln’s Inn; and are very tolerable,
dull, common-place declamation—a little bordering on fustian. But,
as is the invariable fate of Vetus’s arguments, they contain a flat
contradiction to the principle he is aiming to establish. Though the
passage has little to do with the immediate question, we shall give it
as a literary curiosity. It is an instance of one of those lapses of
thought, of that epilepsy of the mind, which we have already pointed
out as the distinguishing characteristic of this author’s understanding.
His object is to exclude all general reasoning, or the seeds of what
he absurdly calls ‘theo-philanthropy’ from the feelings of patriotism;
and in his eagerness to do this, he effectually explodes and laughs to
scorn all patriotism, as a branch of the same theo-philanthropy, as
impracticable and romantic folly. His words are these:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘One of these patriots enacts the part of a drawling hypocritical
projector, whom no natural affection can move, nor individual
happiness enliven. He is a regular brother of a well known sect,
which we of this generation have had the misfortune to behold in
high activity—and which, having seen, it is but wisdom to remember.
The men I speak of were those who in some degree precipitated the
French revolution, and who entirely perverted its possible uses, the
mongrel race of metaphysical enthusiasts, who undertook to change
the objects of human feeling, that they might disappoint more
effectually the ends for which it was bestowed. Such were the
worshippers of the strumpet goddess Reason; a deity, in herself, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>in the prostitute who represented her, convertible to purposes equally
abandoned. The next step, after acknowledging this divinity, was
to make a display of her power. Mankind were to be <em>reasoned</em> out
of <em>all</em> human sensibilities; but the loss was to be supplied by reasoning
them into a new assortment of human sensibilities, on a larger and
nobler scale. Brotherly regard was a puny sentiment; what was a
single brother to him who felt that millions of freemen were his
brothers! Marriage, too, that holy and heavenly<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a> and heart-sustaining
institution, what with its graceful and beautiful assemblage
of bland obligations and virtuous sympathies—how stood the fixed
relation of husband and wife? Why, treason to natural liberty!—“exclusive
tenderness”—a bar to the performance of those unconfined
embraces, which spoke the reign of universal love. Parental affection,
and filial piety, also, were still less worthy to escape the blight of
this ruthless philosophical reform. How narrow was the father’s
mansion! How diminutive the mind that could look with reverence
to the beings that gave it birth, when the republic, sole heiress of
philanthropy and freedom—the great republic, offered herself as the
fond and universal parent. Nor could the sire, who argued logically,
bewail the sacrifice of his devoted offspring. His children—not his,
but their country’s children—were to be educated by and for that
country. His paternal feelings were not to be extinguished—no,
nothing more than transferred to the state, and ennobled by the
magnitude of the object. This same republic was a perfect “Scrub.”
She was to play the sister, husband, wife, son, and mother—confiscating
and appropriating the individual duties, rights, and charities
of mankind—ransacking the deepest recesses of the heart, and seizing
as prizes to her sovereign will the royalties and wrecks of human
nature.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘<em>But the phrenzy did not terminate here.</em> It was not enough that
all the relations of life should merge in that of citizen: even
“exclusive patriotism” was a vulgar thought. In the paroxysms of
disorder, it was sometimes proposed, that the citizen himself should
evaporate into a citizen of the world. The universal republic—the
vast family of mankind—the deputations from the human race—became
instruments with the knaves who led, and visions for the
dupes who admired. There can really be no objection to this superfine
theory, but that it is inconsistent with the order of Providence,
and destructive of the nature of man—that it unfixes our moral
land-marks—melts into air every practical virtue and definite duty—substitutes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>words for salutary deeds—and by directing our most
natural and useful passions to objects indistinct or unattainable, leaves
these powerful agents afloat, and ends by abusing them to the
production of crime and misery. Such were the results of that
system of speculation, which assumed for its basis the existence of
a species of beings far above the pitch of humanity, and which, in its
application to human affairs, reduces them to the level of brutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘A sucker from the root of this poisonous vegetable is again in
blossom, and threatens the desolation of the moral world. We are
called upon to abdicate the right and obligation of preferring and
protecting our native country, that is, of enjoying our proper advantages,
and of discharging our specific trusts—and for what?
Why, that we may undertake the preposterous office, and execute
the factitious duty of handing over to a mortal enemy the greatness to
which we have waded through blood and fire, and raising his empire
on the ruins of our own. Beware, we are warned, of neglecting the
rights of the adversary. It is our peculiar business to guard the
rights of France.’<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c011'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The whole of this pompous episode is a mere diversion to the
question. Vetus, some time ago, asked, in a tone which could not
be mistaken, ‘Who are the French nation? A rank non-entity.
Who are to be the sole judges of the rights and pretensions of what
once was France? We, and our allies!’—and when we protest
against this unheard-of basis of a negociation between rival states, he
answers with a tedious prize-dissertation on the doctrine of universal
benevolence, and the perfectibility of man. Vetus insists on a peace
(the only peace fit for a wise nation) that shall remain a proud
monument of its own superiority,—that is, a peace which can never
be made between any two states, a peace that does not admit of the
shadow of regard to the rights, interests, or honour of the enemy, a
peace that implies a critical advance to the destruction of France.
But it seems, that all this proud display of pedantic phraseology, by
which he attempted to ‘confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed the
very faculties of eyes and ears,’ now means nothing more than that
we are to guard and protect our native country, and not surrender our
own rights to the enemy. There needed no oracle to tell us that.
But Vetus, having set out on the forlorn hope of political paradox, is
himself ashamed to turn back to a trite truism, and contends that
there is no safety for this country but in the destruction of the enemy,
and no patriotism which is not inconsistent with the rights, liberties,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and even existence of other countries. We deny it. We say there is
a patriotism consistent with the claims of reason, justice, and humanity;
and another <em>exclusive</em> of them. The latter is Vetus’s patriotism; the
former is ours. This we have stated before. We do not wonder that
Vetus has not answered it; for it does not admit of an answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seems, however, that the view we have taken (in common with
all civilized nations) of this subject, is ‘a sucker from the poisonous
root of universal benevolence’; and Vetus’s prejudices, coupling with
that <em>strumpet</em> Reason, beget in his mind a sort of ‘mongrel metaphysical
enthusiasm,’ in which he sees visions, and has revelations of
the general nature of man. He tells us, we are regular adepts in
that school which, under the direction of the goddess, or the strumpet,
Reason, (for with him they are both the same) trampled on all
human sensibilities, and the charities of private life, to offer them up
as a sacrifice to that <em>monstrous fiction</em>, their country, and then to that
<em>more monstrous fiction</em>, their kind. This is the most curious defence
of patriotism we ever met with, and a striking instance of the pains
which this laborious reasoner takes to confute himself. Our country,
according to this patriotic writer, is ‘a perfect Scrub,’ a kind of Sin
and Death business, a contradiction, and a dire chimera, ‘confiscating
and appropriating the individual duties, rights, and charities of
mankind—ransacking the deepest recesses of the heart, and seizing
as prizes to her sovereign will the royalties and wrecks of human
nature.’ It is ‘a superfine theory, inconsistent with the order of
Providence, and destructive of the nature of man, and which, by
pretending to raise us far above the pitch of humanity, degrades us
below the level of brutes.’ But then ‘there is a phrenzy still greater’
than this, which is the love of mankind. This is the consummation
of enormity, and the triumph of the strumpet-goddess. Vetus has
here fallen into a more desperate dilemma than any he has yet
encountered in his perilous way. We present him with the choice
of a pair of alternatives: either he must mean that the love of the
republic, or our country, which he treats with such profound contempt
and abhorrence, is only bad when it destroys the private and natural
affections, or he must exclude at once every shadow of regard to the
rights, liberties, and happiness of mankind, and then the same thing
will follow of patriotism itself, which, as he says truly, is an emanation
from the same impure source, human reason, and so to establish his
favourite principle of <em>exclusive</em> patriotism, he gets rid of it altogether.
‘The latter end of this writer’s reasoning always forgets the beginning.’
We will tell Vetus the hinge on which this whole controversy turns,
and what is the radical error of the system of general philanthropy,
which he has attempted to expose. It is, that it is an <em>exclusive</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>system, and is therefore unfitted for the nature of man, who is a mixed
being, made up of various principles, faculties, and feelings. All
these are good in their place and degree, as well as the affections that
spring from them—natural affection, patriotism, benevolence: it is
only <em>exclusive</em> selfishness, <em>exclusive</em> patriotism, <em>exclusive</em> philanthropy,
that are inconsistent with the order of Providence, and destructive of
the nature of man: Vetus in avoiding one extreme has fallen into
another, for the extremes not only ‘of faction’ but of folly meet;
though we should be loth to compare the splendid dreams of the
philosophical enthusiast, who wished to raise man above the pitch of
his common nature, to the groveling, sordid, shuffling paradoxes of
Vetus, who would degrade him below the level of the brutes, and
whose maxims are as repugnant to common sense, and the practical
rules of life, as they are devoid of every thing elegant in imagination,
or consistent in reasoning.</p>

<p class='c013'>We gave in our last article Vetus’s quaint denunciation of the
principles of patriotism and philanthropy. It appears by this, that
the same ‘jargon of metaphysics,’ and the same vapid rhetoric may
be employed against both these sacred and inviolable feelings, by any
one who is weak and vain enough to suppose that language was given
us, not to communicate truth to others, but to impose falsehood on
ourselves. Does Vetus mean to assert, that his <em>topics</em> are fatal to all
patriotism, as well as all philanthropy? Or (which is the alternative)
that they are fatal to neither, properly understood,—that there is a
true and a false patriotism, a true and a false philanthropy? What
will ‘the acknowledged saviours of Europe, the magnanimous defenders
of the commonwealth of nations, the liberators of Spain, the recreators
of Portugal, the regenerators of Germany,’ say to Vetus’s exclusive
patriotism? Or, we would ask, whether the abuse of reason, of
which he complains in certain moderns, is a sufficient cause that we
should explode it altogether? In the dialect of Don Quixote’s books
of chivalry, must ‘the unreasonableness of their reason so unreason
our reason,’ that we are to reject the faculty, both root and branch?
Shall we impiously renounce the goddess, because she has been
personated by a strumpet? Reason is the queen of the moral world,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the soul of the universe, the lamp of human life, the pillar of society,
the foundation of law, the beacon of nations, the golden chain, let
down from heaven, which links all animated and all intelligent
natures in one common system—and in the vain strife between fanatic
innovation, and fanatic prejudice we are exhorted to dethrone this
queen of the world, to blot out this light of the mind, to deface this
fair column, to break in pieces this golden chain! We are to discard
and throw from us, with loud taunts and bitter imprecations, that
reason, which has been the lofty theme of the philosopher, the poet,
the moralist, and the divine, whose name was not first named to be
abused by the enthusiasts of the French revolution, or to be blasphemed
by the madder enthusiasts, their opponents, but is coeval with, and
inseparable from the nature and faculties of man,—is the image of his
Maker stamped upon him at his birth, the understanding breathed
into him with the breath of life, and in the participation of which
alone he is raised above the brute creation, and his own physical
nature!—Vetus labours hard to persuade us, that the goddess and the
strumpet are really one person, equally ‘convertible to the same
abandoned purposes;’ that reason and sophistry are the same thing.
He may find his account in endeavouring to confound them; but his
indifference betrays the hollowness of his claims to true reason, as the
false mother was detected by her willingness to compromise her own
pretensions, only to be revenged on her rival.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vetus has, however, without knowing it, stumbled on an important
truth, which is, that patriotism, in modern times, and in great states,
is and must be the creature of reason and reflection, rather than the
offspring of physical or local attachment. Our country is a complex
abstract existence, known only to the understanding. It is an immense
riddle, containing numberless modifications of reason and prejudice,
of thought and passion. Patriotism is not, in a strict or exclusive
sense, a natural or personal affection, but a law of our rational and
moral nature, strengthened and determined by particular circumstances
and associations, but not born of them, nor wholly nourished by
them. It is not possible that we should have an individual attachment
to sixteen millions of men, any more than to sixty millions. We
cannot be attached, except rationally and ‘logically,’ to places we
never saw, and people we never heard of. Is not the name of
Englishman a general term, as well as that of man? How many
varieties does it not combine within it? Are the opposite extremities
of the globe our native place, because they are a part of that
geographical and political denomination, our country? Does natural
affection expand in circles of latitude and longitude? What personal
or instinctive sympathy has the English peasant with the African
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>slave-driver, or East India nabob? None but the most ‘drawling
hypocritical’ sophist will say that there is any. These wretched
bunglers in metaphysics would fain persuade us to discard all public
principle, and all sense of abstract justice, as a violation of natural
affection, and yet do not see that the love of our country is itself in
the order of our general affections, except, indeed, that exclusive sort
which consists in a mere negation of humanity and justice. The
common notions of patriotism are, in fact, transmitted to us from the
savage tribes, or from the states of Greece and Rome, where the
fate and condition of all was the same, or where the country of the
citizen was the town in which he was born. Where this is no longer
the case, where our country is no longer contained within the narrow
circle of the same walls, where we can no longer behold its glimmering
horizon from the top of our native mountains—beyond these limits it
is not a natural but an artificial idea, and our love of it either an
habitual dictate of reason, or a cant term. It was said by an acute
observer, and eloquent writer, that the love of mankind was nothing
but the love of justice: the same might be said, with considerable
truth, of the love of our country. It is little more than another name
for the love of liberty, of independence, of peace and social happiness.
We do not say, that other indirect and collateral circumstances do
not go to the superstructure of this sentiment, (as language,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c011'><sup>[12]</sup></a> literature,
manners, national customs,) but this is the broad and firm basis. All
other patriotism, not founded on, or not consistent with truth, justice,
and humanity, is a painted sepulchre, fair without, but full of ravening
and all uncleanness within. ‘It leaves our passions afloat, and ends
with abusing them to crime and misery.’ It is the watchword of
faction, the base pander of avarice and pride, the ready tool in the
hands of those who, having no sense of public duty, and disclaiming
all pretensions to common humanity, sacrifice the lives of millions to
the madness of one, and are eager to offer up their country a devoted
victim at the shrine of power, as the miserable slave is yoked to the
foul Eastern idol,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c011'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and crushed beneath its chariot wheels! Thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the hired scribbler of a profligate newspaper sits secure and self-satisfied
at his desk—with a venomed word, or a lie that looks like
truth, sends thousands of his countrymen to death,—receives his pay,
and scribbles on, regardless of the dying and the dead!—And this is
patriotism.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tempora mollia fandi</span></i> do not belong to Vetus any more than to
ourselves. He is, like us, but an uncouth courtier, a rough, sturdy,
independent politician, who thinks and speaks for himself. He
complains of ‘the soft nonsense whispered in the higher circles,’ and
gossipped in <cite>The Morning Post</cite>, in favour of peace. Be it so, for
once, that these soft whispers are fraught with ruin, dishonour, and
slavery to this country. Yet, if the effeminate and dastard sound
once floats through the air, borne on the downy wing of fashion—if
it is whispered from the prince to the peer, and from lords to ladies,
from ministers to their clerks, from their clerks to the treasury-prints,
and from the knaves who write to the dupes who read—even the
warning voice of Vetus will not be able to prevent the Syren sound
from spreading in gentle murmurs, and ‘smoothing the raven down of
discord, till it smiles.’ And will Vetus pretend such ignorance both
of the court and of the country, as not to know, that whether the
word is war or peace, the same effect will follow—that whether the
breath of kings breathe ‘airs from heaven or blasts from hell,’ the
same well-attuned system of undulating sounds will disperse them
wide in eddying circles, and the same round of smiles and whispers
and significant shrugs will be repeated, whether the country bleeds or
starves, is enslaved within, or conquered without? All those who
do not catch the soft whisper, and mimic the gracious smile, and
join the magic circle, are no better than hypocrites, madmen, and
traitors to <em>their country</em>! We know it well.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vetus in vain attempts to repel the charge which we brought
against <cite>The Times</cite>, whose profession of eternal war with Bonaparte
we said was incompatible with the possibility of his making peace
with us, by asserting that this doctrine is ‘an audacious plagiarism,
from the portfolio of the French Minister.’ We have not such near
access to the portfolio of the French Government as this writer; but
we have access to <cite>The Times</cite>, and there we find this audacious
plagiarism written in large letters in almost every page. We say that
wherever the doctrine is found (whoever invented or whoever adopted
it), there is an insuperable bar to peace. If it is found on one side,
that is the responsible side; if it is found on both, neither can
reproach the other with the continuance of hostilities. This
statement is plain and unanswerable. Does Vetus think to ‘thrust
us from a level consideration by a confident brow, and the throng of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>words which come with such affected gravity from him’? He
disclaims the doctrine for himself. Why then is he so eager to
justify it in <cite>The Times</cite>? They are caught in the fact; they are
taken with the <em>manner</em>; and Vetus would divert us from executing
summary justice on them, by offering himself as security that they are
only the receivers of the stolen goods; ‘the audacious plagiarists,’
instead of the atrocious inventors of this mischievous doctrine.
Besides, the answer is a wretched evasion, and makes the assertion
itself senseless and nugatory. The principle of <cite>The Times</cite> was and is
(if they have not retracted it) that we are never to make peace with
Bonaparte at all, that is, though he would make peace with us,
(otherwise the words have no meaning) and then comes the gloss of
Vetus, which is, that we will not make peace with him, only because
he will not make peace with us. Ridiculous!—Vetus asks, ‘Who
has been the founder of this shocking creed—who the aggressor—who
the unrelenting enemies of peace?’ May we not answer—‘The
incessant war-faction of England’? Why would Vetus strip ‘these
acknowledged saviours of Europe’ of the praise which is so justly
due to them, or degrade them from that proud eminence which they
have maintained with so much persevering fortitude? We cannot
withhold from these persons our sincere conscientious thanks for all
the benefits which this war has conferred on our country, on Europe,
and the world. While France strove insidiously to ruin us by peace,
these firm patriots have always been determined to save us by war—from
‘England’s greatest and most magnanimous politician,’ down to
the last desperate incendiary of <cite>The Times</cite>, who is only willing to
conclude ‘a Regicide Peace’ by celebrating ‘the condign and solemn
punishment of Bonaparte!’<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c011'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Vetus says, that ‘eternal war is no expression of his, and that it is
a deliberate falsehood in us who assert that he has used it, or that
this country has no alternative between eternal war and eternal
bondage.’ ‘It is not England,’ he says, ‘but France—not Vetus,
but the French government—who has broached the creed, and one of
the two countries must in the end destroy the other.’</p>

<p class='c010'>If it is a falsehood, it is a deliberate one, for we do deliberately
assert that he uses these words, and inculcates this doctrine incessantly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>But instead of contradicting Vetus, it is better to let him
contradict himself; no one else can do it so effectually. In his last
letter but one he has these words:—‘It is, I conscientiously believe,
a question, <em>which of these two countries shall destroy the other</em>. In
that case my part is taken.—France must be ruined to save our
native country from being ruined.—If this be perpetual war, I cannot
help it.—Perpetual war has little terror, when perpetual bondage
threatens us.’ Either the interpretation of this passage is that which
we have given to it, or, as Vetus says, ‘the English language must be
constructed anew.’</p>

<p class='c010'>He now, indeed, mitigates the dread sentence he had passed upon
us, by saying, not that we have no alternative but either war, or
slavery, or <em>peace</em>. We are glad that Vetus has introduced this new
clause in our favour into the codicil; it was not in the original will,
or expressed in such faint characters, that we, with the rest of the
public, missed the intended benefaction. Just in the same manner,
that profound politician and humane writer, the author of the Essay
on Population, found out that the only possible checks to excessive
population, were vice and misery, which were, therefore, to be
considered as the greatest blessings of mankind, and having gained a
vast reputation by this singular discovery, he then recollected what
every one knew before, that there was another check to this principle,
viz. <em>moral restraint</em>, and that consequently vice and misery were not
the greatest blessings of society.</p>

<p class='c010'>We did not state it as an inconsistency in Vetus, that he held out
<em>France</em> as an object of terror, and yet recommended a negociation
with Bonaparte, because his government tended to weaken France,
but we did state it as a rank inconsistency in Vetus to hold up
<em>Bonaparte</em> as an object of peculiar terror to this country, and yet to
represent his government as tottering on the brink of deplorable
weakness and unavoidable ruin. Vetus could not meet the objection,
and he has altered the terms.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vetus concludes his letter with the following note:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘<em>The stupid impertinence</em>’ (charged on the attacks made upon him)
‘has no relation to <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite>, with which I am disposed
to part in peace. One feels a tolerance towards that paper, for the
talents which once adorned it; and of the continuance of which I
should rejoice to see more proof in its late attacks on Vetus. We
have little common faith in politics, but we have, I trust, a common
stake in the spirit and dignity of the press.’</p>

<p class='c010'>We are obliged to Vetus for this amicable offer, of the sincerity of
which we entertain no doubt. As to the talent shown in our attacks
on him, we are ready to admit that it is little enough; but we at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>same time think that if it had been greater, it would have been more
than the occasion required. We have no enmity to Vetus, but to his
extravagance, and if he will correct that, he will save us the trouble
of correcting it for him. We are ready to believe that this writer
has talents and acquirements which might be made useful to the
public, if he would forego his mistaken pretensions to extraordinary
wisdom and eloquence. The qualities of profound thought and
splendid imagery are seldom found singly in the same person, and the
union of both together is an undertaking much beyond the capacity of
Vetus. And now we leave him to return to his indigestions with
‘what appetite he may.’<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c011'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The systematic patrons of eternal war are always returning, when
they dare, to the point from which they set out twenty years ago;
the war with them has not yet lost its original character: they have
long memories: they never lose sight of their objects and principles.
We cannot but admire their candour as well as their consistency, and
would wish to imitate it. It is deemed necessary by the everlasting
war-faction to prove in their own justification, ‘that the march to Paris
was not chimerical in 1793,’ by carrying it into effect now, and to
blot France out of the map of Europe, three-and-twenty years after
the event had been announced by that great prophet and politician,
Mr. Burke. This splendid reverie is not yet accomplished. The
triumph of the Pitt-school over the peace-faction is not yet complete;
but we are put in complete possession of what is required to make it
so. As the war with them was a war of extermination, so the peace,
not to fix a lasting stigma on their school and principles, must be a
peace of extermination. This is what we always said and thought of
those principles and that school. This is their triumph, their <em>only</em>
triumph—the true crown of their hopes, the consummation of their
utmost wishes, nothing short of which can satisfy their proud pretensions,
or finish this just and necessary war, as it was begun.
Otherwise, no peace for them; otherwise, they will have failed in
both branches of that happy dilemma, hit upon by the beneficent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>genius of ‘the great statesman, now no more,’ the necessity of destroying
France, or being ourselves destroyed in the attempt. If they
succeed in neither experiment, all that they have done is surely lost
labour. They have then a right to their revenge, ‘their pound of
carrion-flesh’—‘’tis theirs, ’tis dearly bought, and they will have it.’
Be it so. But we shall let them feast alone: we are not <em>man-eaters</em>.
We shall not join the barbarous yell of this worse than Thracian rout,
nor figure in at the close of their dance of death, nor applaud the
catastrophe of their twenty years’ tragedy. We did not approve it in
its commencement or progress; nor will we hail its threatened conclusion.
We have had, and we will have, no hand in the plot, the
execution, the scene-shifting, or the decoration. We leave the full
credit of it to the original authors; and, in spite of all the puffing of
the Bayes’s of the Pitt-school, the only answer they will get from us
is, ‘’Tis an indifferent piece of work: would ’twere done!’ Though
the torch of <cite>The Times</cite> blazes over Paris, ‘fierce as a comet’; though
<cite>The Sun</cite> sees the lilied banner of the Bourbons floating before Lord
Wellington in the plains of Normandy; though <cite>The Courier</cite> is setting
out post-haste to break up the negociations at Chatillon; and <cite>The
Morning Herald</cite> sheds tears of joy over the fashionable virtues of the
rising generation, and finds that we shall make better man-milliners,
better lacqueys, and better courtiers than ever—we remain sceptical
as to the success, and more than sceptical as to the necessity of this
last cast of our political dicers, and desperate venture of our licenced
dealers and chapmen in morality and massacre. In our opinion, lives
enough have been thrown away to prove, that the survivors are only
born to <em>bear fardels</em>. This is the moral of the piece, if it succeeds on
the principles of the Pitt-school, and all short of that is mere
gratuitous mischief. The war, conducted on those principles and for
those purposes, ‘was not, and it cannot come to good.’ Its failure,
or its success, must be fatal.</p>

<p class='c010'>The war, as it was carried on from the first by the Pitt-school, and
as they would now revive it, was not a national quarrel, but a question
about a political principle. It had no more to do with France or
England as geographical denominations, than the wars between the
Guelphs and Gibelines. It was not a war of mercantile advantage,
or a trial of strength between two countries, which must be decided
by the turn of events, by the probable calculation of loss and profit,
but a war against an opinion, which could, therefore, never cease, but
with the extirpation of that opinion. Hence there could be neither
safety, nor honour, nor justice, in any terms of peace with the French
government, because, by the supposition, it was not with its power or
its conduct, but with its existence, that we were at war. Hence the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>impossibility of maintaining the relations of peace and amity with
France. Hence Mr. Burke’s regicide war. Hence the ridiculousness
asserted by <cite>The Courier</cite>, of even attempting negociation with this
hated power. Hence the various and contradictory aspects which the
war assumed after its first outset, and all of which answered the purpose
equally well, because there was another pivot on which the
whole turned, the sheet-anchor which never loosed its hold, and
which enabled ‘the pilot to weather the storm.’ It was not a
temporary or local question of the boundaries, the possessions, or
particular rights of rival states, but a question, in which all states are
at all times equally interested, of the internal right of any people to
choose its own form of government. Whether this was a just ground
of war or not, is another question; but it was the true one—that
which gave its character to the war, and accounts for all its consequences.
It was a war of proscription against a great and powerful
state, for having set the example of a people ridding itself of an odious
and despicable tyranny. It was the question of the balance of power
between kings and people; a question, compared with which the
balance of power in Europe is petty and insignificant. That what we
have here stated, are the real and paramount grounds of this bloody
and inveterate contest in the minds of the war-faction is, what we
apprehend they will not, in their present state of frenzy, deny. They
are the only ones that always survive the shock of accident and the
fluctuation of circumstances, and which are always recurred to when
all others fail, and are constantly avowed in the face of day, whenever
the least probability of success attends them. It has been
declared again and again, month after month, and year after year,
that no peace should be made with France till the last remaining
effort had been tried to attain this object. We were to bury ourselves
with our great war-minister, under the ruins of the civilized
world, sooner than relax in our exertions, or recede from our object.
No sacrifices were to be held too dear—no sufferings too great in the
prosecution of this sacred cause. No other than the last extremity
was to force peace from us. Nothing short of the complete subjugation
of France was to satisfy us—nothing short of our own ruin was
to drive us to despair. We were like wrestlers, struggling on the
edge of a precipice, one (or both) of whom must be certain of
destruction. Such were the mad, mischievous, and unprincipled
terms, on which a pampered crew of sycophants have played away
the welfare, the repose, the liberties, and happiness of mankind, and
on which they would now urge us to stake our all again, to realize
their favourite scheme of the march to Paris, and the annihilation of
the French people.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The consequences of the Pitt project were inevitable. From the
moment that the existence of France as a nation was declared to be
incompatible with that of the surrounding states—that she was
denounced as a nuisance which must be abated, and set up as a mark
for the vengeance of the rest of the world, the struggle necessarily
became convulsive, and the re-action terrible. Is it then a matter of
wonder, that in this unnatural strife, France, proscribed, hunted down,
put out of the pale of nations, endeavoured rather to reduce others to
the last extremity than to be reduced to it herself? Or are we
entitled to wreak that vengeance upon her which we could not at
first execute, because the engine which we had prepared to crush her
has recoiled with the greatest violence upon ourselves? It has been
said that we less easily forgive the injuries we do or meditate against
others, than those we receive from them. There are, we know,
persons to whom the celebrated line of the historian is, at all times,
applicable: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Odia in longum jaciens, quæ conderet, auctaque promeret</span></i>.
We are not surprised to find that the good intentions of these persons
towards France, though she did not submit to the original tender
made to her of their kind interference and paternal care, have not
spoiled by keeping. If Titus complained with so much bitterness,
that he had lost a day to virtue, what must not some modern friends
to mankind feel, when they reflect that they have lost so many years
in the execution of their just and beneficent plans!—In spite of
Mr. Southey’s reasoning in his <em>Carmen Triumphale</em>, about joining
‘the avengers of mankind,’ we conceive that the wheel has gone
once round already, ‘full circle home,’ and that now it had better
stand still.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it may be said, do we mean to apply these remarks to Bonaparte?
As far as relates to any merits of the war-faction. It was
they who implicated him with the cause of the French people, as
‘the child and champion of Jacobinism.’ We cannot express our
opinion better than in the words of Mr. Whitebread, ‘that England
had made Bonaparte, and he had undone himself.’ He was the
creature of the Pitt-school. Was the iron scourge which he has held
over Europe put into his hands by the peace-party? Were the
battles of Austerlitz and Jena—were the march to Vienna, the possession
of Berlin, the invasion of Spain, the expedition to Russia, and
the burning of Moscow, the consequences of the signing or of the
breaking of the treaty of Amiens?</p>

<p class='c010'>The author of the letters of Vetus, (who we suppose is silenced
by <cite>The Times</cite>, for asserting that the Bourbons have no more a lawful
right to the throne of France, at this moment, than the Stuarts had
to the throne of England twenty years after the Revolution of 1688,)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>is of opinion, that this war is merely national, merely the old grudge
between the two countries; and that the Bourbons, the Republic,
and Bonaparte, are equally hostile to England, and we to them. In
this, as in most things else, our opinion is the opposite of his. There
is only one period of the history of the two countries, which, reversed,
furnishes an exact counterpart to the present contest, both in its
avowed principles and secret motives—we mean the war waged by
Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> against this country and its allies, for nearly as long a
period after the English Revolution. The difference in the results
of these two revolutions has been this: that from the insular situation
of this country, which enables us to do either right or wrong, nearly
with impunity, and which makes our means of defence greater, and
our means of offence proportionably less—that from this collateral
cause, the internal struggle, in proportion to the danger, was less
bloody in our own case, and the re-action of our efforts to defend
ourselves from the imposition of a foreign yoke and of hereditary
slavery, less violent and fatal to other states. All the differences
have arisen from the character of the two nations, and from local and
accidental circumstances: there was none in the abstract political
principle. We gave them the example of their Revolution; we also
gave them an example of ‘national fortitude’ in maintaining it. We—the
people of England, (not an upstart jacobite faction in the
Hanoverian line,) are proud of having imitators; and we think it
not unlikely that the French, if forced upon it, may behave on this
occasion as the English behaved, when an hereditary pretender came
over to us, backed by the aid of foreign arms, to assert his lawful
claim to the throne—that is, in other words, to be the natural proprietor
of a whole people. We twice sent him back again with all
his myrmidons; we would not be made a property of. We felt that
in not doing so we should be traitors, not only to our country, but to
our kind—the worst species of treason to our country. It is curious
that the ‘deepest enmity which the French people have drawn down
upon them by their early struggles in the same cause, should be shewn
by that government who had long insulted the slavery of Europe by
the loudness of its boasts of freedom.’ We do not know how it is,
but so it has happened, that in the thirty years of war which have
graced the annals of the present reign, there has been a considerable
want of sympathy between the crown and the people, as if the quarrel
were merely the cause of kings, in which the people had no
concern. Has this circumstance arisen from any unpleasant sense
of obligation, or consciousness of a little irregularity and deviation
from the right line in the descent of the crown, no more accounted
for in Mr. Burke’s Reflections, than the declination of atoms in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Epicurus’s philosophy? The restoration of the Bourbons in France
will be the re-establishment of the principles of the Stuarts in this
country.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c011'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>1. That the French people were so deeply implicated in the
Slave trade, as not even to know that it had been abolished by this
country.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. That the French press had been so long under the complete
despotic control of Bonaparte, that the present government must
despair of making any immediate impression on the independence of
the political opinions, or the energetic firmness of the individual feelings
of the people, lately consigned to their protection.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. That such were their blind and rooted prejudices against the
English, that we could only hope to convince them of our entire
sincerity and disinterestedness in abolishing the Slave Trade ourselves,
by lending a helping hand to its revival by others.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. That if we consented to give up our colonial conquests to the
French, on conditions dictated only by the general principles of
humanity, this would be a proof that we intended to keep them in
our hands from the most base and mercenary motives.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. That the French government simply wished to begin the Slave
Trade again as the easiest way of leaving it off, that so they might
combine the experiment of its gradual restoration with that of its
gradual abolition, and, by giving the people an interest in it, more
effectually wean their affections from it.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. That it is highly honourable in us to have proposed, and in the
French to have agreed to, the abolition of the Slave Trade, at the
end of five years, though it would have been insulting in us to have
proposed, and degrading in them to have submitted to, any stipulation
on the subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. That to rob and murder on the coast of Africa is among the
internal rights of legislation and domestic privileges of every European
and Christian state.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. That we are not to teach the French people religion and
morality at the point of the sword, though this is what we have been
professing to teach them for the last two and twenty years.</p>

<p class='c010'>9. That his most Christian Majesty Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span> is so fully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>impressed with the humane and benevolent sentiments of Great
Britain and the allies in favour of the abolition of the Slave Trade,
that he was ready to have plunged all Europe into a war for its
continuance.</p>

<p class='c010'>10. That we could not possibly make the abolition, (though the
French government would certainly have made the revival) of the
Slave Trade a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</span></i> in the treaty of peace, and that they
would otherwise have gone to war to recover by force of arms
what they can only owe to the credulity or complaisance of our
negociators.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly. That by consenting to the re-establishment of the Slave
Trade in France, we were most effectually preparing the way for its
abolition all over the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘With so little a web as this will I ensnare so great a fly as
<em>Cassio</em>!’—Such were the formidable barriers, the intricate lines of
circumvallation, drawn by the French round the abolition of the
Slave Trade, as strong as those which they threw up to defend their
capital: yet we think, that after our political missionary had overleaped
the one, he might have broken through the other. Where
there is a will, there is a way. But there are some minds to which
every flimsy pretext presents an insurmountable obstacle, where only
the interests of justice and humanity are at stake. These persons are
always impotent to save—powerful only to oppress and to betray.
Their torpid faculties and amiable apathy are never roused but by
the calculations of self-interest, or the thirst of revenge. The glossy
sleekness of the panther’s skin does not blunt the sharpness of his
fangs, and his fawning eye dooms his victim while it glitters. But
to come to Lord Castlereagh. In the present instance, he appears to
have been cajoled into acquiescence from his well-known indifference
to the object. His speech contained nothing but a story of a cock
and a bull, told by M. Talleyrand with great grace and gravity,
assented to by his Lordship with equal affability and address, and
repeated to the House of Commons with hesitating volubility and
plausible negligence of manner. It is well to sacrifice to the graces;
but it is too much to have sacrificed a whole continent to the graces
of M. Talleyrand’s person, or the purity of his French accent. We
can imagine how the scene took place. This question of Africa,
being considered as an idle question, in which neither courts nor
ministers were concerned, would be naturally left as a sort of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte-blanche</span></i>
for all the flourishes of national <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">politesse</span></i>, as a kind of <em>no man’s
ground</em> for a trial of diplomatic skill and complaisance. So Lord
Castlereagh, drawing on his gloves, hemmed once or twice, while
the French minister carelessly took snuff: he then introduced the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>question with a smile, which was answered by a more gracious smile
from M. Talleyrand: his Lordship then bowed, as if to bespeak
attention; but the Prince of Benevento bowing still lower, prevented
what he had to say; and the cries of Africa were lost amidst the
nods and smile and shrugs of these demi-puppets. The Ex-bishop of
Autun may in future hope to find a successful representative in the
English Ambassador from Paris; for the noble secretary <em>mistified</em> the
house, as he had himself been <em>mistified</em> by his highness of Benevento.—Count
Fathom, after his defeat by the French abbé, practised in
this his adopted country with great applause! We may take this
opportunity of remarking, that we do not think his Lordship at all
improved during his stay in France. He performs the arc of his
oscillation from the treasury bench to the table, and from the table
back again, in a second less time than he used to do. He commits
dulness with greater vivacity, and flounders more briskly in an argument.
He has enhanced the loose dangling slip-shod manner which
so well accords with his person and understanding, into something
positive and dogmatical; and is even grown tenacious of the immaculateness
of his maiden treaty, which he will not have so much as
suspected: In this alteration of tone we think him wrong. We have
always looked upon Lord Castlereagh as an excellent taffeta lining to
a court dress; but he should leave the buckram of office to his friend
the secretary of the Admiralty.</p>

<p class='c010'>An excellent article appeared in the <span class='sc'>Examiner</span> of last week, giving
a general outline of the views and principles which ought to actuate
the allied powers at the approaching Congress, and of the leading
arrangements with respect to the different subjects to be brought
under consideration, which ought to follow from those principles.
Cordially as we agree with this respectable writer in the several
points which he has stated, we are, we confess, far from feeling any
strong assurances that even any one of these points will be amicably
adjusted. They are briefly these:—1. That Poland should be
restored to her independence. 2. That the other powers of Europe
should no longer co-operate with Sweden in the subjugation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Norway. 3. That the Slave Trade should be immediately and generally
abolished. 4. That Saxony should not share a fate similar to that
of Poland. 5. That Austria should relinquish her views of unjust
aggrandisement in Italy. 6. and last, That some concessions should
probably be made by England as to her exclusive claims to maritime
supremacy, as far as those claims are found to be rather galling to the
feelings of other nations, than essential to her own security. All of
the objects here recommended are, we should imagine, every way
practicable as well as desirable, if there were any thing like a hearty
good-will to avail themselves of the present favourable situation of the
world in those who have the power to decide its fate. Armed with
sovereign authority, seconded by public opinion, with every obstacle
removed from their dread of the overwhelming power of France, they
have all the means at their disposal to rear a splendid, lofty, and lasting
monument to justice, liberty, and humanity. Are the views then
of the allied sovereigns solely directed to these objects? That is the
simple question; and we are afraid it would be great presumption
to answer it in the affirmative. It would be supposing that the late
events have purified the hearts of princes and nations; that they have
been taught wisdom by experience, and the love of justice from the
sense of injury; that mutual confidence and good-will have succeeded
to narrow prejudices and rankling jealousy; that the race of ambitious
and unprincipled monarchs, of crafty politicians, and self-interested
speculators is at an end; that the destructive rivalry between states
has given way to liberal and enlightened views of general safety and
advantage; and that the powers of Europe will in future unite with
the same zeal and magnanimity for the common good, as when they
were bound in a common cause against the common enemy. All this
appears to us quite as Utopian as any other scheme which supposes
that the human mind can change. Happy should we be, if instead of
those magnificent and beneficial projects in which some persons seem
still to indulge their imaginations as the results of this meeting, the
whole should not turn out to be no better than a compromise of petty
interests, of shallow policy, and flagrant injustice.</p>

<p class='c010'>We forbore for a long time from saying any thing on this ungrateful
subject: but our forbearance has not hitherto, at least, been rewarded.
We shall therefore speak out plainly on the subject; as we should be
sorry to be thought accomplices in a delusion, which can only end in
disappointment. The professions of justice, moderation, and the love
of liberty, made by the powers of Europe at the end of the last, and
at the beginning of the present year, were certainly admirable:
they were called for at the time, and were possibly sincere. But we
are all of us apt to forego those good resolutions which are extorted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>from us by circumstances rather than from reason or habit, and to
recant ‘vows made in pain as violent and void.’ Without meaning
any indirect allusion to the person into whose mouth these words are
put, we believe this, that princes are princes, and that men are men;
and that to expect any great sacrifices of interest or passion from
either in consequence of certain well-timed and well-sounding professions,
drawn from them by necessity, when that necessity no longer
exists, is to belie all our experience of human nature. We remember
what modern courts and ministers were before the dreaded power of
Bonaparte arose; and we conceive this to be the best and only
ground to argue what they will be, now that that power has ceased.
‘Why so, being gone, they are themselves again.’ It appears to us,
that some very romantic and extravagant expectations were entertained
from the destruction of the tyranny of Bonaparte. It is true,
his violence and ambition for a while suspended all other projects of
the same kind. ‘The right divine of kings to govern wrong’ was
wrested from the puny hands of its legitimate possessors, and strangely
monopolized by one man. The regular professors of the regal art
were set aside by the superior skill and prowess of an adventurer.
They became in turn the tools, or the victims of the machinations
of the maker and puller-down of kings. Instead of their customary
employment of annoying their neighbours, or harassing their subjects,
they had enough to do to defend their territories and their titles.
The aggressions which they had securely meditated against the independence
of nations, and their haughty contempt for the liberties of
mankind, were retorted on their own heads. The poisoned chalice
was returned to their own lips. They then first felt the sting of
injustice, and the bitterness of scorn. They saw how weak and little
they were in themselves. They were roused from the still life of
courts, and forced to assume the rank of men. They appealed to
their people to defend their thrones; they called on them to rally
round the altar of their country; they invoked the name of liberty,
and in that name they conquered. Plans of national aggrandisement
or private revenge were forgotten in the intoxication of triumph, as
they had been in the agony of despair. This sudden usurpation had
so overpowered the imaginations of men, that they began to consider
it as the only evil that had ever existed in the world, and that with
it, all tyranny and ambition would cease. War was talked of as if it
had been an invention of the modern Charlemagne, and the Golden
age was to be restored with the Bourbons. But it is hard for the
great and mighty to learn in the school of adversity: emperors and
kings bow reluctantly to the yoke of necessity. When the panic is
over, they will be glad to drink of the cup of oblivion. The false
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>idols which had been set up to Liberty and Nature, to Genius and
Fortune, are thrown down, and they have once more ‘all power
given them upon earth.’ How they are likely to use it, whether
for the benefit and happiness of mankind, or to gratify their own
prejudices and passions, we have, in one or two instances, seen
already. No one will in future look for ‘the milk of human kindness’
in the Crown Prince of Sweden, who is a monarch of the new
school; nor for examples of romantic generosity and gratitude in
Ferdinand of Spain, who is one of the old. A jackal or baboon,
dandled in the paws of a royal Bengal tiger, may not be very formidable;
but it would be idle to suppose, if they should providentially
escape, that they would become tame, useful, domestic animals.</p>

<p class='c010'>The King of Prussia has recovered the sword of the Great
Frederick, his humane, religious, moral, and unambitious predecessor,
only, as it appears, to unsheath it against the King of Saxony, his
old companion in arms. The Emperor of Austria seems eager to
catch at the iron crown of Italy, which has just fallen from the brows
of his son-in-law. The King of France, <em>our</em> King of France, Louis
the Desired, and who by the ‘all hail hereafter,’ is to receive the
addition of Louis the Wise, has improved his reflections during a
twenty years’ exile, into a humane and amiable sanction of the renewal
of the Slave Trade for five years only. His Holiness the Pope,
happy to have escaped from the clutches of the arch-tyrant and
impostor, employs his leisure hours in restoring the order of the
Jesuits, and persecuting the Freemasons. Ferdinand, the grateful
and the enlightened, who has passed through the same discipline of
humanity with the same effect, shuts up the doors of the Cortes, (as
it is scandalously asserted, at the instigation of Lord Wellington),
and throws open those of the Inquisition. At all this, the romantic
admirers of patriot kings, who fondly imagined that the hatred of the
oppressor was the same thing as the hatred of oppression, (among
these we presume we may reckon the poet-laureat,) hang their heads,
and live in hope of better times. To us it is all natural, and in order.
From this grand gaol-delivery of princes and potentates, we could
expect nothing else than a recurrence to their old habits and favourite
principles. These observations have not been hastily or gratuitously
obtruded: they have been provoked by a succession of disgusting and
profligate acts of inconsistency and treachery, unredeemed by a single
effort of heroic virtue or generous enthusiasm. Almost every principle,
almost every profession, almost every obligation, has been
broken. If any proof is wanting, look at Norway, look at Italy,
look at Spain, look at the Inquisition, look at the Slave Trade.
The mask of liberty has been taken off by most of the principal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>performers; the whining cant of humanity is no longer heard in <cite>The
Courier</cite> and <cite>The Times</cite>. What then remains for us to build a hope
upon, but the Whig principles of the Prince Regent, inherited from
his ancestors, and the good nature of the Emperor of Russia, the
merit of which is entirely his own? Of the former of these personages,
our opinion is so well known, that we need not repeat it
here. Again, of the good intentions of the last-mentioned sovereign,
we declare that we have as full a persuasion. We believe him to be
docile to instruction, inquisitive after knowledge, and inclined to good.
But it has been said by those who have better means of information
than ourselves, that he is too open to the suggestions of those about
him; that, like other learners, he thinks the newest opinion the best,
and that his real good-nature and want of duplicity render him not
sufficiently proof against the selfish or sinister designs of others. He
has certainly a character for disinterestedness and magnanimity to
support in history: but history is a glass in which few minds fashion
themselves. If in his late conduct there was any additional impulse
given to the natural simplicity of his character, it probably arose from
an obvious desire to furnish a contrast to the character of Bonaparte,
and also to redeem the Russian character, hitherto almost another
name for barbarity and ferociousness, in the eyes of civilized Europe.
In this point of view, we should not despair that something may be
attempted, at least with respect to Poland, by the present autocrat of
all the Russias, to blot out certain stains on the reputation of his
grand-mother, the Empress Catherine.</p>

<p class='c010'>With regard to Norway, the only hope of the suspension of its
fate seems to arise out of a very natural, if not laudable jealousy and
distaste, which have been conceived by some of the old-standing
sovereigns of Europe against the latest occupier and most forward
pretender to thrones. An adventurer who has made a fortune by
gaining a prize in the lottery, or by laying <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui tam</span></i> informations against
his accomplices, cannot expect to be admitted, on an equality, into
the company of persons of regular character and family estates. The
Emperor of Austria, in particular, may have additional motives of
dislike to Bernadotte, connected with late events; and we agree with
the <em>Examiner</em>, that he may, in the end, ‘have to regret the length to
which he was hurried against a man, who was the key-stone of all
the new power which had been built on the ruin of thrones.’</p>

<p class='c010'>As to any immediate adjustment of the maritime rights of this
country, on general principles, satisfactory to all parties, we see no
reason to expect it. We think the following paragraph justifies us in
this opinion. ‘We are told,’ says the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, ‘that on
the day when the capture of the city of Washington, and the demolition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of its public buildings reached Paris, the Duke of Wellington
had a ball: not one public ambassador of the potentates of Europe,
our good allies, presented himself to congratulate his grace on the
event.’ We here see, on one side, the most absurd expectations of
disinterested sympathy with our national feelings, and as little disposition
to enter into them on the other. It is strange that the above
paragraph should have found its way into a paper which makes an
almost exclusive profession of liberal and comprehensive views.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor can we indulge in any serious expectations of ‘the immediate
and general abolition of the Slave Trade.’ Africa has little to hope
from ‘the prevailing gentle arts’ of Lord Castlereagh. However
sturdy he may be in asserting our maritime rights, he will, we
imagine, go to sleep over those of humanity, and waking from his
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doux sommeil</span></i>, find that the dexterous prince of political jugglers has
picked his pocket of his African petitions, if, indeed, he chuses to
carry the credentials of his own disgrace about with him. There
are two obstacles to the success of this measure. In the first place,
France has received such forcible lessons from this country on the
old virtues of patriotism and loyalty, that she must feel particularly
unwilling to be dictated to on the new doctrines of liberality and
humanity. Secondly, the abolition of the Slave Trade, on our part,
was itself the act of Mr. Fox’s administration—an administration
which we should suppose there is no very strong inclination to relieve
from any part of the contempt or obloquy which it has been the
fashion to pour upon it, by extending the benefit of its measures, or
recommending the adoption of its principles.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is another point, on which, though our doubts are by no
means strong or lasting, we do not at all times feel the same
absolute confidence—the continuance of the present order of things
in France. The principles adhered to in the determination of
some of the preceding arrangements, and the permanent views
which shall appear to actuate the other powers of Europe, may
have no inconsiderable influence on this great question. Whatever
tends to allay the ferment in men’s minds, and to take away just
causes of recrimination and complaint, must, of course, lessen the
pretexts for change. We should not, however, be more disposed to
augur such a change from the remaining attachment of individuals,
or of the army, to Bonaparte, than from the general versatility
and restlessness of the French character, and their total want of
settled opinion, which might oppose a check to military enthusiasm.
Even their present unqualified zeal, in the cause of the Bourbons, is
ominous. How long this sudden fit of gratitude, for deliverance
from evils certainly brought upon them by their slowness to admit the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>remedy, may continue, it is impossible to say. A want of <em>keeping</em> is
the distinguishing quality of the French character. A people of this
sort cannot be depended on for a moment. They are blown about
like a weathercock, with every breath of caprice or accident, and
would cry <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vive l’empereur</span></i> to-morrow, with as much vivacity and as
little feeling, as they do <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vive le roi</span></i> to-day. They have no fixed
principle of action. They are alike indifferent to every thing: their
self-complacency supplies the place of all other advantages—of
virtue, liberty, honour, and even of outward appearances. They
are the only people who are vain of being cuckolded and being
conquered.—A people who, after trampling over the face of Europe
so long, fell down before their assailants without striking a blow,
and who boast of their submission as a fine thing, are not a nation of
men, but of women. The spirit of liberty, at the Revolution, gave
them an impulse common to humanity; the genius of Bonaparte
gave them the spirit of military ambition. Both of these gave an
energy and consistency to their character, by concentrating their
natural volatility on one great object. But when both of these causes
failed, the Allies found that France consisted of nothing but ladies’
toilettes. The army are the muscular part of the state; mere
patriotism is a pasteboard visor, which opposes no resistance to the
sword. Whatever they determine will be done; an effeminate
public is a non-entity. They will not relish the Bourbons long, if
they remain at peace; and if they go to war, they will want a
monarch who is also a general.</p>

<p class='c013'>The dog which his friend Launce brought as a present to Madam
Silvia in lieu of a lap-dog, was something like ‘The Lay of the
Laureate,’ which Mr. Southey has here offered to the Princess
Charlotte for a Nuptial Song. It is ‘a very currish performance,
and deserves none but currish thanks.’ Launce thought his own
dog, Crab, better than any other; and Mr. Southey thinks his own
praises the fittest compliment for a lady’s ear. His Lay is ten times
as long, and he thinks it is therefore ten times better than an Ode of
Mr. Pye’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Southey in this poem takes a tone which was never heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>before in a drawing-room. It is the first time that ever a
Reformist was made a Poet-laureate. Mr. Croker was wrong in
introducing his old friend, the author of ‘Joan of Arc,’ at Carlton-House.
He might have known how it would be. If we had
doubted the good old adage before, ‘Once a Jacobin and always
a Jacobin,’ since reading ‘The Lay of the Laureate,’ we are sure
of it. A Jacobin is one who would have his single opinion govern
the world, and overturn every thing in it. Such a one is Mr.
Southey. Whether he is a Republican or a Royalist,—whether
he hurls up the red cap of liberty, or wears the lily, stained with the
blood of all his old acquaintance, at his breast,—whether he glories
in Robespierre or the Duke of Wellington—whether he pays a visit
to Old Sarum, or makes a pilgrimage to Waterloo,—whether he is
praised by <cite>The Courier</cite>, or parodied by Mr. Canning,—whether he
thinks a King the best or the worst man in his dominions,—whether he
is a Theophilanthropist or a Methodist of the church of England,—whether
he is a friend of Universal Suffrage and Catholic Emancipation,
or a Quarterly Reviewer,—whether he insists on an equal
division of lands, or of knowledge,—whether he is for converting
infidels to Christianity, or Christians to infidelity,—whether he is for
pulling down the kings of the East or those of the West,—whether
he sharply sets his face against all establishments, or maintains that
whatever is, is right,—whether he prefers what is old to what is
new, or what is new to what is old,—whether he believes that all
human evil is remediable by human means, or makes it out to himself
that a Reformer is worse than a housebreaker,—whether he is in
the right or the wrong, poet or prose-writer, courtier or patriot,—he
is still the same pragmatical person—every sentiment or feeling
that he has is nothing but the effervescence of incorrigible overweening
self-opinion. He not only thinks whatever opinion he
may hold for the time infallible, but that no other is even to be
tolerated, and that none but knaves and fools can differ with him.
‘The friendship of the good and wise is his.’ If any one is so
unfortunate as to hold the same opinions that he himself formerly
did, this but aggravates the offence by irritating the jealousy of
his self-love, and he vents upon them a double portion of his
spleen. Such is the constitutional slenderness of his understanding,
its ‘glassy essence,’ that the slightest collision of sentiment gives
an irrecoverable shock to him. He regards a Catholic or a Presbyterian,
a Deist or an Atheist, with equal repugnance, and makes
no difference between the Pope, the Turk, and the Devil. He
thinks a rival poet a bad man, and would suspect the principles,
moral, political, and religious, of any one who did not spell the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>word <em>laureate</em> with an <em>e</em> at the end of it.—If Mr. Southey were
a bigot, it would be well; but he has only the intolerance of
bigotry. His violence is not the effect of attachment to any principles,
prejudices, or paradoxes of his own, but of antipathy to
those of others. It is an impatience of contradiction, an unwillingness
to share his opinions with others, a captious monopoly
of wisdom, candour, and common sense. He is not an enthusiast
in religion, but he is an enemy to philosophers; he does not respect
old establishments, but he hates new ones; he has no objection to
regicides, but he is inexorable against usurpers; he will tell you that
‘the re-risen cause of evil’ in France yielded to ‘the Red Cross and
Britain’s arm of might,’ and shortly after he denounces this Red
Cross as the scarlet whore of Babylon, and warns Britain against her
eternal malice and poisoned cup; he calls on the Princess Charlotte
in the name of the souls of ten thousand little children, who are
without knowledge in <em>this age of light</em>, ‘<span class='sc'>Save or we perish</span>,’ and yet
sooner than they should be saved by Joseph Fox or Joseph Lancaster,
he would see them damned; he would go himself into Egypt and
pull down ‘the barbarous kings’ of the East, and yet his having gone
there on this very errand is not among the least of Bonaparte’s
crimes; he would ‘abate the malice’ of the Pope and the Inquisition,
and yet he cannot contain the fulness of his satisfaction at the
fall of the only person who had both the will and the power to do
this. Mr. Southey began with a decent hatred of kings and priests,
but it yielded to his greater hatred of the man who trampled them in
the dust. He does not feel much affection to those who are born to
thrones, but that any one should gain a throne as he has gained the
laureate-wreath, by superior merit alone, was the unpardonable sin
against Mr. Southey’s levelling Muse!</p>

<p class='c010'>The poetry of the Lay is beneath criticism; it has all sorts of
obvious common-place defects, without any beauties either obvious or
recondite. It is the Namby-Pamby of the Tabernacle; a Methodist
sermon turned into doggrel verse. It is a gossipping confession of
Mr. Southey’s political faith—the ‘Practice of Piety’ or the ‘Whole
Duty of Man’ mixed up with the discordant slang of the metaphysical
poets of the nineteenth century. Not only do his sentiments every
where betray the old Jacobinical leaven, the same unimpaired desperate
unprincipled spirit of partisanship, regardless of time, place, and
circumstance, and of every thing but its own headstrong will; there
is a gipsey jargon in the expression of his sentiments which is equally
indecorous. Does our Laureate think it according to court-etiquette
that he should be as old-fashioned in his language as in the cut of his
clothes?—On the present occasion, when one might expect a truce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>with impertinence, he addresses the Princess neither with the fancy
of the poet, the courtier’s grace, nor the manners of a gentleman, but
with the air of an inquisitor or father-confessor. Geo. Fox, the
Quaker, did not wag his tongue more saucily against the Lord’s
Anointed in the person of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>, than our Laureate here assures
the daughter of his Prince, that so shall she prosper in this world and
the next, as she minds what he says to her. Would it be believed
(yet so it is) that, in the excess of his unauthorized zeal, Mr. Southey
in one place advises the Princess conditionally to rebel against her
father? Here is the passage. The Angel of the English church
thus addresses the Royal Bride:-</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Bear thou that great Eliza in thy mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who from a wreck this fabric edified;</div>
      <div class='line'>And <span class='sc'>Her</span> who to a nation’s voice resigned,</div>
      <div class='line'>When Rome in hope its wiliest engines plied,</div>
      <div class='line'><em>By her own heart and righteous Heaven approved,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Stood up against the Father whom she loved</em>.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This is going a good way. Is it meant, that if the Prince Regent,
‘to a nation’s voice resigned,’ should grant Catholic Emancipation in
defiance of the ‘Quarterly Review,’ Mr. Southey would encourage the
Princess in standing up against her father, in imitation of the pious and
patriotic daughter of James <span class='fss'>II.</span>?</p>

<p class='c010'>This quaint effusion of poetical fanaticism is divided into four parts,
the Proem, the Dream, the Epilogue, and L’Envoy. The Proem
opens thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘There was a time when all my youthful thought</div>
      <div class='line'>Was of the Muse; and of the Poet’s fame,</div>
      <div class='line'>How fair it flourisheth and fadeth not, ...</div>
      <div class='line'>Alone enduring, when the Monarch’s name</div>
      <div class='line'>Is but an empty sound, the Conqueror’s bust</div>
      <div class='line'>Moulders and is forgotten in the dust.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This may be very true, but not so proper to be spoken in this
place. Mr. Southey may think himself a greater man than the
Prince Regent, but he need not go to Carlton-House to tell him so.
He endeavours to prove that the Prince Regent and the Duke of
Wellington (put together) are greater than Bonaparte, but then he
is by his own rule greater than all three of them. We have here
perhaps the true secret of Mr. Southey’s excessive anger at the late
Usurper. If all his youthful thought was of his own inborn superiority
to conquerors or kings, we can conceive that Bonaparte’s fame must
have appeared a very great injustice done to his pretensions; it is not
impossible that the uneasiness with which he formerly heard the names
of Marengo, of Austerlitz, of Jena, of Wagram, of Friedland, and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Borodino, may account for the industrious self-complacency with
which he harps upon those of Busaco, Vimiera, Salamanca, Vittoria,
Thoulouse, and Waterloo; and that the Iron Crown of Italy must
have pressed upon his (Mr. Southey’s) brows, with a weight most
happily relieved by the light laureate-wreath! We are justified in
supposing Mr. Southey capable of envying others, for he supposes
others capable of envying him. Thus he sings of himself and his
office:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Yea in this now, while malice frets her hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is foretaste given me of that meed divine;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here undisturbed in this sequestered bower,</div>
      <div class='line'>The friendship of the good and wise is mine;</div>
      <div class='line'>And that green wreath which decks the Bard when dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>That laureate garland crowns my living head.</div>
      <div class='line'>That wreath which in Eliza’s golden days</div>
      <div class='line'>My master dear, divinest Spenser, wore,</div>
      <div class='line'>That which rewarded Drayton’s learned lays,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which thoughtful Ben and gentle Daniel<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c011'><sup>[17]</sup></a> bore ...</div>
      <div class='line'>Grin, Envy, through thy ragged mask of scorn!</div>
      <div class='line'>In honour it was given, with honour it is worn!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Now we do assure Mr. Southey, that we do not envy him this
honour. Many people laugh at him, some may blush for him, but
nobody envies him. As to Spenser, whom he puts in the list of great
men who have preceded him in his office, his laureateship has been
bestowed on him by Mr. Southey; it did not ‘crown his living head.’
We all remember his being refused the hundred pounds for his ‘Fairy
Queen.’ Poets were not wanted in those days to celebrate the
triumphs of princes over the people. But why does he not bring his
list down nearer to his own time—to Pye and Whitehead and Colley
Cibber? Does Mr. Southey disdain to be considered as the successor
even of Dryden? That green wreath which decks our author’s living
head, is so far from being, as he would insinuate, an anticipation of
immortality, that it is no credit to any body, and least of all to Mr.
Southey. He might well have declined the reward of exertions in a
cause which throws a stigma of folly or something worse on the best
part of his life. Mr. Southey ought not to have received what would
not have been offered to the author of ‘Joan of Arc.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Southey himself maintains that his song has still been
‘to Truth and Freedom true’; that he has never changed his
opinions; that it is the cause of French liberty that has left him,
not he the cause. That may be so. But there is one person in the
kingdom who has, we take it, been at least as consistent in his conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and sentiments as Mr. Southey, and that person is the King. Thus
the Laureate emphatically advises the Princess:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Look to thy Sire, and <em>in his steady way,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>As in his Father’s he</em>, learn thou to tread.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Now the question is, whether Mr. Southey agreed with his Majesty
on the subject of the French Revolution when he published ‘Joan of
Arc.’ Though Mr. Southey ‘as beseems him well’ congratulates
the successes of the son, we do not recollect that he condoled with
the disappointments of the father in the same cause. The King has
not changed, therefore Mr. Southey has. The sun does not turn to
the sun-flower; but the sun-flower follows the sun. Our poet has
thoughtlessly committed himself in the above lines. He may be right
in applauding that one sole purpose of his Majesty’s reign which he
formerly condemned: that he can be consistent in applauding what
he formerly condemned, is impossible. That his majesty King
George <span class='fss'>III.</span> should make a convert of Mr. Southey rather than Mr.
Southey of George <span class='fss'>III.</span> is probable for many reasons. The King by
siding with the cause of the people could not, like King William,
have gained a crown: Mr. Southey, by deserting it, has got a
hundred pounds a-year. A certain English ambassador, who had
a long time resided at the court of Rome, was on his return introduced
at the levee of Queen Caroline. This lady, who was almost as great
a prig as Mr. Southey, asked him why in his absence he did not try
to make a convert of the Pope to the Protestant religion. He
answered, ‘Madam, the reason was that I had nothing better to offer
his Holiness than what he already has in his possession.’ The Pope
would no doubt have been of the same way of thinking. This is the
reason why kings, from sire to son, pursue ‘their steady way,’ and
are less changeable than canting cosmopolites.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Though we do not think Mr. Southey has been quite consistent,
we do not think him a hypocrite. This poem proves it. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>should he maintain the same opinion all his life, when he cannot
maintain it for two stanzas together? The weakness of his reasoning
shews that he is the dupe of it. He has not the faculty of perceiving
contradictions. He is not accountable for his mistakes. There is
not a single sentiment advanced in any part of the <em>Lay</em>, which is not
flatly denied in some other part of it. Let us see:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Proudly I raised the high thanksgiving strain</div>
      <div class='line'>Of victory in a rightful cause achieved:</div>
      <div class='line'>For which <em>I long had looked and not in vain,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>As one who with firm faith and undeceived,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>In history and the heart of man could find</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Sure presage of deliverance for mankind</em>.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Southey does not inform us in what year he began to look for
this deliverance, but if he had looked for it long, he must have looked
for it long in vain. Does our poet then find no presage of deliverance
for ‘conquered France’ in the same principles that he found it for
‘injured Germany’? But he has no principles; or he does not
himself know what they are. He praises Providence in this particular
instance for having conformed to his hopes; and afterwards
thus gives us the general results of his reading in history and the
human heart. In the Dream he says, speaking of Charissa and
Speranza—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘This lovely pair unrolled before the throne</div>
      <div class='line'>“Earth’s melancholy map,” whereon to sight</div>

      <div class='line'>Well might the thoughtful bosom sigh to mark</div>
      <div class='line'>How wide a portion of the map was dark.</div>

      <div class='line'>Sinning and suffering, everywhere unblest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Behold her wretched sons, oppressing and opprest!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This is ‘a pretty picture’ to be drawn by one who finds in the
past history of the world the sure presage of deliverance for mankind.
We grant indeed that Mr. Southey was right in one thing, viz. in
expecting from it that sort of ‘deliverance of mankind,’ bound hand
and foot, into the power of Kings and Priests, which has actually
come to pass, and which he has celebrated with so much becoming
pomp, both here and elsewhere. The doctrine of ‘millions made
for one’ has to be sure got a tolerable footing in the East. It has
attained a very venerable old age there—it is mature even to rottenness,
but without decay. ‘Old, old, Master Shallow,’ but eternal.
It is transmitted down in unimpaired succession from sire to son.
Snug’s the word. Legitimacy is not there militant, but triumphant,
as the Editor of <cite>The Times</cite> would wish. It is long since the people
had any thing to do with the laws but to obey them, or any laws to
obey but the will of their taskmasters. This is the necessary end of
legitimacy. The Princes and Potentates cut one another’s throats as
they please, but the people have no hand in it. They have no French
Revolutions there, no rights of man to terrify barbarous kings, no
republicans or levellers, no weathercock deliverers and re-deliverers
of mankind, no Mr. Southeys nor Mr. Wordsworths. In this they
are happy. Things there are perfectly settled, in the state in which
they should be,—still as death, and likely to remain so. Mr.
Southey’s exquisite reason for supposing that a crusade to pull down
divine right would succeed in the East, is that a crusade to prop it
up has just succeeded in the West. That will never do. Besides,
what security can he give, if he goes on improving in wisdom for the
next five and twenty years as he has done for the last, that he would
not in the end be as glad to see these ‘barbarous kings’ restored to
their rightful thrones, as he is now anxious to see them tumbled from
them? The doctrine of ‘divine right’ is of longer standing and
more firmly established in the East than in the West, because the
Eastern world is older than ours. We might say of it,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The wars it well remembers of King Nine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of old Assaracus and Inachus divine.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is fixed on the altar and the throne, safe, quite safe against Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Southey’s enthusiasm in its second spring, his Missionary Societies,
and his Schools for All. It overlays that vast continent, like an
ugly incubus, sucking the blood and stopping up the breath of man’s
life. That detestable doctrine, which in England first tottered and
fell headless to the ground with the martyred Charles; which we
kicked out with his son James, and kicked twice back with two
Pretenders, to make room for ‘Brunswick’s fated line,’ a line of our
own chusing, and for that reason worth all Mr. Southey’s lines put
together; that detestable doctrine, which the French, in 1793, ousted
from their soil, thenceforward sacred in the eyes of humanity, which
they ousted from it again in 1815, making it doubly sacred; and
which (oh grief, oh shame) was borne into it once more on English
shoulders, and thrust down their throats with English bayonets; this
detestable doctrine, which would, of right and with all the sanctions
of religion and morality, sacrifice the blood of millions to the least of
its prejudices; which would make the rights, the happiness, and
liberty of nations, from the beginning to the end of time, dependent
on the caprice of some of the lowest and vilest of the species; which
rears its bloated hideous form to brave the will of a whole people;
that claims mankind as its property, and allows human nature to exist
only upon sufferance; that haunts the understanding like a frightful
spectre, and oppresses the very air with a weight that is not to be
borne; this doctrine meets with no rubs, no reverses, no ups and
downs, in the East. It is there fixed, immutable. The Jaggernaut
there passes on with its ‘satiate’ scythe over the bleeding bodies of
its victims, who are all as loyal, as pious, and as thankful as Mr.
Southey. It meets with no opposition from any ‘re-risen cause of
evil’ or of good. Mankind have there been delivered once for all!</p>

<p class='c010'>In the passage above quoted, Mr. Southey founds his hope of the
emancipation of the Eastern world from ‘the Robber and the Trader’s
ruthless hand’ on our growing empire in India. This is a conclusion
which nobody would venture upon but himself. His last appeal is
to scripture, and still he is unfortunate:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Speed thou the work, Redeemer of the World!</div>
      <div class='line'><em>That the long miseries of mankind may cease!</em></div>
      <div class='line'>Where’er the Red Cross banner is unfurled,</div>
      <div class='line'>There let it carry truth, and light, and peace!</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Did not the Angels who announced thy birth,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Proclaim it with the sound of Peace on Earth?</em>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>From the length of time that this prediction has remained unfulfilled,
Mr. Southey thinks its accomplishment must be near. His
Odes will not hasten the event.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Again, we do not understand the use which Mr. Southey makes of
Red Cross in this poem. For speaking of himself he says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And when that last and most momentous hour</div>
      <div class='line'>Beheld the re-risen cause of evil yield</div>
      <div class='line'>To the Red Cross and England’s arm of power,</div>
      <div class='line'>I sung of Waterloo’s unrivalled field,</div>
      <div class='line'>Paying the tribute of a soul embued</div>
      <div class='line'>With deepest joy, devout and awful gratitude.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This passage occurs in the Proem. In the Dream the Angel of
the English Church is made to warn the Princess—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Think not that lapse of ages shall abate</div>
      <div class='line'>The inveterate malice of that Harlot old;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fallen tho’ thou deemest her from her high estate,</div>
      <div class='line'>She proffers still the envenomed cup of gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>And her fierce Beast, whose names are blasphemy,</div>
      <div class='line'>The same that was, is still, and still must be.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It is extraordinary that both these passages relate to one and the
same thing, namely, Popery, which our author in the first identifies
with the Christian religion, thus invoking to his aid every pure
feeling or pious prejudice in the minds of his readers, and in the
last denounces as that Harlot old, ‘whose names are blasphemy,’
with all the fury of plenary inspiration. This is a great effort of
want of logic. Mr. Southey will hardly sing or say that it was
to establish Protestantism in France that England’s arm of power
was extended on this occasion. Nor was it simply to establish
Popery. That existed there already. It was to establish ‘the
inveterate malice of that Harlot old,’ her ‘envenomed cup,’ to
give her back her daggers and her fires, her mummeries, her
holy oil, her power over the bodies and the minds of men, to restore
her ‘the same that she was, is still, and still must be,’ that that
celebrated fight was fought. The massacres of Nismes followed
hard upon the triumph of Mr. Southey’s Red Cross. The blood
of French Protestants began to flow almost before the wounds of
the dying and the dead in that memorable carnage had done festering.
This was the most crying injustice, the most outrageous
violation of principle, that ever was submitted to. What! has
John Bull nothing better to do now-a-days than to turn bottle-holder
to the Pope of Rome, to whet his daggers for him, to light his fires,
and fill his poisoned bowl; and yet, out of pure complaisance (a
quality John has learnt from his new friends the Bourbons) not
venture a syllable to say that we did not mean him to use them? It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>seems Mr. Southey did not think this a fit occasion for the interference
of his Red Cross Muse. Could he not trump up a speech
either for ‘divine Speranza,’ or ‘Charissa dear,’ to lay at the foot of
the throne? Was the Angel of the English Church dumb too—‘quite
chopfallen?’ Yet though our Laureate cannot muster resolution
enough to advise the Prince to protect Protestants in France, he
plucks up spirit enough to urge him to persecute Catholics in this
country, and pretty broadly threatens him with the consequences, if
he does not. “’Tis much,” as Christopher Sly says.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is another subject on which Mr. Southey’s silence is
still more inexcusable. It was understood to be for his exertions
in the cause of Spanish liberty that he was made Poet-Laureate.
It is then high time for him to resign. Why has he not written
a single ode to a single Spanish patriot who has been hanged,
banished, imprisoned, sent to the galleys, assassinated, tortured?
It must be pleasant to those who are suffering under the thumb-screw
to read Mr. Southey’s thoughts upon that ingenious little
instrument of royal gratitude. Has he discovered that the air
of a Court does not very well agree with remonstrances against
acts of oppression and tyranny, when exercised by those who are
born for no other purpose? Is his patriotism only a false cover,
a Carlton-House convenience? His silence on this subject is not
equivocal. Whenever Mr. Southey shews the sincerity of his
former professions of zeal in behalf of Spanish liberty, by writing
an elegy on the death of Porlier, or a review of the conduct of
Ferdinand <span class='fss'>VII</span>. (he is a subject worthy of Mr. Southey’s prose style),
or by making the lame tailor of Madrid (we forget his name) the
subject of an epic poem, we will retract all that we have said in
disparagement of his consistency—<em>But not till then</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>We meant to have quoted several other passages, such as that
in which old Praxis, that is, Experience, recommends it to the
Princess to maintain the laws by keeping all that is old, and adding
all that is new to them—that in which he regrets the piety
and learning of former times, and then promises us a release from
barbarism and brutishness by the modern invention of Sunday Schools—that
in which he speaks of his own virtues and the wisdom
of his friends—that in which he undertakes to write a martyrology.—But
we are very tired of the subject, and the verses are not worth
quoting. There is a passage in Racine which is; and with that, we
take our leave of the Laureate, to whom it may convey some useful
hints in explanation of his ardent desire for the gibbeting of Bonaparte
and the burning of Paris:—</p>

  <h4 class='c017'>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EXAMINER</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Sir,—I hope you will not omit to notice two passages in Mr.
Southey’s poem, in which, to try his talent at natural description,
he gives an account of two of ‘the fearfullest wild-fowl living’—a
British Lion and a Saxon one. Both are striking likenesses, and
would do to hang on the outside of Exeter-‘Change to invite the
curious. The former (presumed not to be indigenous) is described
to be in excellent case, well-fed, getting in years and corpulent, with
a high collar buried in the fat of the neck, false mane, large haunches
(for which this breed is remarkable), paws like a shin of beef, large
rolling eyes, a lazy, lounging animal, sleeping all day and roaring all
night, a great devourer of carcases and breaker of bones, pleased after
a full meal, and his keepers not then afraid of him. Inclined to be
uxorious. Visited by all persons of distinction, from the highest
characters abroad down to the lowest at home.—The other portrait
of the Saxon Lion is a contrast to this. It is a poor lean starved
beast, lord neither of men nor lands, galled with its chain, which it
has broken, but has not got off from its neck. This portrait is, we
understand, to be dedicated to Lord Castlereagh.—Your constant
reader,</p>

<p class='c010'>‘A <em>New</em> View of Society’—No, Mr. Owen, that we deny. It
may be true, but it is not new. It is not coeval, whatever the author
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>and proprietor may think, with the New Lanark mills, but it is as
old as the royal borough of Lanark, or as the county of Lanark
itself. It is as old as the ‘Political Justice’ of Mr. Godwin, as the
‘Oceana’ of Harrington, as the ‘Utopia’ of Sir Thomas More, as
the ‘Republic’ of Plato; it is as old as society itself, and as the
attempts to reform it by shewing what it ought to be, or by teaching
that the good of the whole is the good of the individual—an opinion
by which fools and honest men have been sometimes deceived, but
which has never yet taken in the knaves and knowing ones. The
doctrine of Universal Benevolence, the belief in the Omnipotence of
Truth, and in the Perfectibility of Human Nature, are not new, but
‘Old, old,’ Master Robert Owen;—why then do you say that they
are new? They are not only old, they are superannuated, they are
dead and buried, they are reduced to mummy, they are put into the
catacombs at Paris, they are sealed up in patent coffins, they have
been dug up again and anatomised, they have been drawn, quartered
and gibbetted, they have become black, dry, parched in the sun,
loose, and rotten, and are dispersed to all the winds of Heaven!
The chain in which they hung up the murdered corse of human
Liberty is all that remains of it, and my Lord Shallow keeps the
key of it! If Mr. Owen will get it out of his hands, with the aid
of Mr. Wilberforce and the recommendation of <cite>The Courier</cite>, we will
‘applaud him to the very echo, which shall applaud again.’ Till
then, we must content ourselves with ‘chaunting remnants of old
lauds’ in the manner of Ophelia:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘No, no, he is gone, and we cast away moan,</div>
      <div class='line'>And will he not come again,</div>
      <div class='line'>And will he not come again?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps, one of these days, he may ... ‘like a cloud over the
Caspian’: then if ever, and never till then, human nature will hold
up its head again, and the holy and Triple Alliance will be dissolved.
But as to this bald spectre of Liberty and Necessity conjured up by
Mr. Owen from the falls of the Clyde, with a primer in one hand, and
a spinning-jenny in the other, coming down from the Highlands in a
Scotch mist, and discoverable only by second-sight, we may fairly
say to it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou hast no speculation in those eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which thou dost glare with.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Why does Mr. Owen put the word ‘New,’ in black-letter at the
head of the advertisements of his plan of reform? In what does
the New Lanark differ from the old Utopia? Is Scotland, after all,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the true Lubber-land? Or must the whole world be converted into
a cotton-factory? Does not Mr. Owen know that the same scheme,
the same principles, the same philosophy of motives and actions, of
causes and consequences, of knowledge and virtue, of virtue and
happiness, were rife in the year 1793, were noised abroad then, were
spoken on the house-tops, were whispered in secret, were published
in quarto and duodecimo, in political treatises, in plays, poems, songs,
and romances—made their way to the bar, crept into the church,
ascended the rostrum, thinned the classes of the universities, and
robbed ‘Durham’s golden stalls’ of their hoped-for ornaments, by
sending our aspiring youth up to town to learn philosophy of the new
teachers of philosophy; that these ‘New Views of Society’ got into
the hearts of poets and the brains of metaphysicians, took possession
of the fancies of boys and women, and turned the heads of almost
the whole kingdom: but that there was one head which they never
got possession of, that turned the heads of the whole kingdom round
again, stopped the progress of philosophy and necessity by wondrous
fortitude, and that ‘thus repelled, <em>philosophy</em> fell into a sadness, then
into a fast, thence to a watching, then into a weakness, thence to a
lightness, and by this declension, to the lamentable state wherein it
now lies,’ hooted by the boys, laughed at by the women, spit at by
fools, trod upon by knaves, damned by poet-laureates, whined over
by maudlin metaphysicians, rhymed upon by mincing ballad-makers,
ridiculed in romances, belied in histories and travels, pelted by the
mob, sneered at by the court, driven from the country, kicked out
of society, and forced to take refuge and to lie snug for twenty years
in the New Lanark mills, with the connivance of the worthy
proprietor, among the tow and spindles; from whence he lets us
understand that it is coming up again to Whitehall-stairs, like a
spring-tide with the full of the moon, and floating on the blood that
has flowed for the restoration of the Bourbons, under the patronage
of the nobility, the gentry, Mr. Wilberforce, and the Prince Regent,
and all those who are governed, like these great personages, by no
other principle than truth, and no other wish than the good of mankind!
This puff will not take with us: we are old birds, not to be
caught with chaff: we shall not purchase in this new lottery, where
there are all prizes and no blanks! We are inclined to throw Mr.
Owen’s ‘New View,’ behind the fire-place, as we believe most people
do the letter they receive from the proprietors of the lucky lottery-office,
informing them that their ticket was drawn a blank the first
day, and in the postscript soliciting their future favours!</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Owen may think that we have all this while been jesting,
when we have been in sad and serious earnest. Well, then, we will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>give him the reason why we differ with him, out of ‘an old saw,’
as good as most ‘modern instances.’ It is contained in this
sentence:—‘If to do were as easy as to teach others what were
good to be done, chapels had been churches, and poor men’s cottages
princes’ palaces.’ Our author has discovered no new theory; he
has advanced no new reasons. The former reasons were never
answered, but the plan did not succeed. Why then does he think
<em>his</em> must? All that he has done has been to leave out the reasons
for his paradoxes, and to give his conclusions in capitals. This may
take for a time with Mr. Wilberforce and the Methodists, who like
hieroglyphics, but it cannot last. Here is a plan, strange as it may
seem, ‘a new View of Society,’ published by two of our most loyal
booksellers, and what is still more extraordinary, puffed in <cite>The
Courier</cite> as an extremely practical, practicable, solid, useful, and good
sort of work, which proposes no less than to govern the world
without religion and without law, by the force of reason alone!
This project is in one of its branches dedicated to the Prince Regent,
by which (if carried into effect) he would be stuck up in his life-time
as ‘a useless piece of antiquity’; and in another part is dedicated to
Mr. Wilberforce, though it would by the same rule convert that little
vital member of the community into ‘a monkey preacher,’ crying in
the wilderness with no one to hear him, and sneaking about between
his character and his conscience, in a state of ludicrous perplexity, as
indeed he always appears to be at present! What is most remarkable
is, that Mr. Owen is the first philosopher we ever heard of, who
recommended himself to the great by telling them disagreeable truths.
A man that comes all the way from the banks of the Clyde acquires
a projectile force that renders him irresistible. He has access, we
understand, to the men in office, to the members of parliament, to
lords and gentlemen. He comes to ‘pull an old house about their
ears,’ to batter down all their establishments, new or old, in church
or in state, civil, political, and military, and he quietly walks into
their houses with his credentials in his pocket, and reconciles them
to the prospect of the innumerable Houses of Industry he is about to
erect on the site of their present sinecures, by assuring them of the
certainty of his principles and the infallibility of his practice, in
building up and pulling down. His predecessors were clumsy
fellows; but he is an engineer, who will be sure to do their
business for them. He is not the man to set the Thames on fire,
but he will move the world, and New Lanark is the place he has
fixed his lever upon for this purpose. To shew that he goes roundly
to work with great people in developing his formidable system of the
formation of character, he asks, p. 7 of the second Essay,—</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>‘How much longer shall we continue to allow generation after
generation to be taught crime from their infancy, and when so taught,
hunt them like beasts of the forest, until they are entangled beyond
escape in the toils and nets of the law? When, if the circumstances
from youth of these poor unpitied sufferers had been reversed with
those who are even surrounded with the pomp and dignity of justice,
these latter would have been at the bar of the culprit, and the former
would have been in the judgment-seat.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Had the present Judges of these realms, whose conduct compels
the admiration of surrounding states, been born and educated in
St. Giles’s, or some similar situation, is it not reasonable to conclude,
as they possess native energies and abilities, that ere this they would
have been at the head of their <em>then</em> profession, and in consequence of
that superiority and proficiency, have already suffered imprisonment,
transportation, or death? Or can we for a moment hesitate to
decide, that if some of those men whom our laws, dispensed by
the present Judges, have doomed to suffer capital punishment, had
been born, trained, and surrounded as these Judges were born,
trained, and surrounded; that some of those so imprisoned, transported,
or hanged, would have been the identical individuals who
would have passed the same awful sentences <em>on our present highly
esteemed dignitaries of the law</em>?’</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a delicate passage. So then according to the author of
the ‘New View of Society,’ the Prince Regent of these realms,
instead of being at the head of the allied sovereigns of Europe,
might, in other circumstances, have been at the head of a gang of
bravoes and assassins; Lord Castlereagh, on the same principle, and
by parity of reasoning, without any alteration in his nature or understanding,
but by the mere difference of situation, might have been a
second <em>Count Fathom</em>; Mr. Vansittart, the chancellor of the exchequer,
might, if he had turned his hand that way in time, have succeeded
on <em>the snaffling lay</em>, or as a pickpocket; Lord Wellington might
have entered houses, instead of entering kingdoms, by force; the
Lord-chancellor might have been a Jew-broker; the Marquis of
—— or Lord —— a bawd, and their sons, tapsters and bullies
at bagnios; the Queen (God bless her) might have been an old
washer-woman, taking her snuff and gin among her gossips, and her
daughters, if they had not been princesses, might have turned out no
better than they should be! Here’s a levelling rogue for you!
The world turned inside out, with a witness!—Such are Mr. Owen’s
general principles, to which we have nothing to say, and such his
mode of illustrating them in his prefaces and dedications, which we
do not think the most flattering to persons in power. We do not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>however, wish him to alter his tone: he goes swimmingly on at
present, ‘with cheerful and confident thoughts.’ His schemes thus
far are tolerated, because they are remote, visionary, inapplicable.
Neither the great world nor the world in general care any thing
about New Lanark, nor trouble themselves whether the workmen
there go to bed drunk or sober, or whether the wenches are got with
child before or after the marriage ceremony. Lanark is distant,
Lanark is insignificant. Our statesmen are not afraid of the perfect
system of reform he talks of, and, in the meantime, his cant against
reform in parliament, and about Bonaparte, serves as a practical
diversion in their favour. But let the good which Mr. Owen says
he has done in one poor village be in danger of becoming general,—let
his plan for governing men by reason, without the assistance of
the dignitaries of the church and the dignitaries of the law, but once
get wind and be likely to be put in practice, and his dreams of
elevated patronage will vanish. Long before he has done as much
to overturn bigotry and superstition in this country, as he says
Bonaparte did on the continent, (though he thinks the restoration of
what was thus overturned also a great blessing) Mr. Wilberforce will
have cut his connection. When we see Mr. Owen brought up for
judgment before Lord Ellenborough, or standing in the pillory, we
shall begin to think there is something in this <cite>New Lanark Scheme</cite> of
his. On the other hand, if he confines himself to general principles,
steering clear of practice, the result will be the same, if ever his
principles become sufficiently known and admired. Let his ‘New
View of Society’ but make as many disciples as the ‘Enquiry
concerning Political Justice,’ and we shall soon see how the tide will
turn about. There will be a fine hue and cry raised by all <em>the good
and wise</em>, by all ‘those acute minds’ who, Mr. Owen tells us, have
not been able to find a flaw in his reasonings, but who will soon
discover a flaw in his reputation. Dr. Parr will preach a Spital
sermon against him; lectures will be delivered in Lincoln’s Inn
Hall, to prove that a perfect man is such another chimera as a golden
mountain; Mr. Malthus will set up his two checks of vice and
misery as insuperable bars against him; Mr. Southey will put him
into the ‘Quarterly Review’; his name will be up in the newspapers,
<cite>The Times</cite>, <cite>The Courier</cite>, and <cite>The Morning Post</cite>; the three estates
will set their faces against him; he will be marked as a Jacobin, a
leveller, an incendiary, in all parts of the three kingdoms; he will be
avoided by his friends, and become a bye-word to his enemies; his
brother magistrates of the county of Lanark will refuse to sit on the
bench with him; the spindles of his spinning-jennies will no longer
turn on their soft axles; he will have gone out for wool, and will go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>home shorn; and he will find that it is not so easy or safe a task as
he imagined to make fools wise, and knaves honest; in short, to
make mankind understand their own interests, or those who govern
them care for any interest but their own. Otherwise, all this matter
would have been settled long ago. As it is, things will most
probably go on as they have done, till some comet comes with its
tail; and on the eve of some grand and radical reform, puts an end
to the question.</p>

<h3 class='c003'><span class='sc'>The Speech of Charles C. Western</span>, Esq.

M.P. <em>on the same subject, delivered in the same place, April 9, 1816</em>.</h3>

<p class='c008'>This is a sore subject; and it is here handled with much tenderness
and delicacy. It puts one in mind of the traveller’s nose, and the
nuns of Strasburgh, in the tale of Slaukenbergius. ‘I will touch it,
said one; I dare not touch it, said another; I wish I had touched
it, said a third; let me touch it, said a fourth.’ While the gentlewomen
were debating the point, the traveller with the great nose
rode on. It would be no ungracious task to treat of the distresses of
the country, if all were distressed alike; but that is not the case;
nor is it possible to trace the necessities of one part of the community
to their source, or to hint at a remedy, without glancing invidiously
at the superfluities of others. ‘Aye, there’s the rub, that makes
calamity of so long life.’ The speeches before us are to the subject
what a veil is to a lady’s face, or a blind to a window. Almost all
that has been said or written upon it is a palpable delusion—an
attempt to speak out and say nothing; to oppose something that
might be done, and propose something that cannot be done; to direct
attention to the subject, and divert it from it; to do something and
nothing; and to come to this potent conclusion, that while nothing
<em>is done</em>, nothing <em>can be done</em>. ‘But have you then any remedy to
propose instead?’ What sort of a remedy do you mean? ‘Oh,
one equally safe and efficacious, that shall set every thing to rights,
and leave every thing just as it is, that does not touch either the
tythes or the national debt, nor places and pensions, nor property of
any kind, except the poor’s fund; <em>that</em> you may take from them to
make them independent of the rich, as you leave Lord Camden in
possession of thirty thousand a year to make him independent of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>poor.’—Why, then, what if the Lord Chancellor and the Chancellor
of the Exchequer were to play a game at push-pin on the top of
St. Paul’s; or if Mr. Brougham and Mr. Horner were to play at
cat’s-cradle on the top of the Monument; or if the little garden
between the Speaker’s house and the river-side were to be sown with
pearls and cockle-shells? Or if——Pshaw! Patience, and shuffle
the cards.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great problem of our great problem-finders appears to be, <em>to
take nothing from the rich, and give it to the poor</em>. That will never do.

<p class='c010'>The war has cost the country five or six hundred millions of
money. This has not been a nominal expense, a playing at ducks
and drakes with the King’s picture on the water, or a manufacturing
of bank-notes, and then lighting our pipes with them, but a real
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> waste of the means, wealth, labour, produce, or resources
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>of the country, in the carrying on of the war. About one hundred
of these five or six hundred millions have been sent directly out of
the country in loans to our Allies, from the year 1793 to the year
1815, inclusive, during which period there is not a single year in
which we did not (from our desire of peace with the legitimate
government of that country) subsidise one or all of the powers of
Europe, to carry on war against the rebels, regicides, republicans,
and usurpers of France. Now the interest of this money alone
would be five millions yearly, which would be nearly enough to pay
the amount of the poor-rates of the whole country, which is seven
millions of our yearly taxes, or might at least be applied to mitigate
the mild severity of Mr. Malthus’s sweeping clauses on that defenceless
part of the subject. Here is a hundred millions then gone clean
out of the country: there are four or five hundred millions more
which have been sunk in the expenses of the war, and which might
as well have been sunk in the sea; or what has been saved out of the
wreck by those who have been most active in running the vessel
aground, is in the hands of persons who are in no hurry that the
public should go snacks with them in their excessive good fortune.
In all three cases, and under each several head of loans, waste, or
monopoly, John Bull pays the piper, or the interest of the whole
money in taxes. He is just so many hundred millions the worse for
the war, (whoever may be the better for it) not merely in paper,
which would be nothing, nor in golden guineas, which would be
something; but in what is better and more substantial than either, in
goods and chattels, in the produce of the soil, and the work of his
hands—in the difference between what the industry of man, left to
itself, produces in time of peace for the benefit of man, and what the
same industry, under the direction of government, produces in time
of war for the destruction of others, without any benefit to himself,
real, imaginary, or pretended; we mean in a physical and economical
point of view, which is here the question—a question, which seems
to last when the religion, politics, and morality of the affair are over.
We have said that the expenses of the war might as well have been
sunk in the sea; and so they might, for they have been sunk in
unproductive labour, that is, in maintaining large establishments, and
employing great numbers of men in doing nothing or mischief; for
example, in making ships to destroy other ships, guns and gunpowder
to blow out men’s brains, pikes and swords to run them through the
body, drums and fifes to drown the noise of cannon and the whizzing
of bullets; in making caps and coats to deck the bodies of those who
live by killing others; in buying up pork and beef, butter and cheese,
to enable them to do this with more effect: in barracks, in transport-ships,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>in baggage and baggage-waggons, in horses, bridles and saddles,
in suttlers and followers of the camp, in chaplains of the regiment, in
common trulls, and the mistresses of generals and commanders in
chief; in contractors, in army and navy agents, their partners, clerks,
relations, dependants, wives, families, servants in and out of livery,
their town and country houses, coaches, curricles, parks, gardens,
grottos, hot-houses, green-houses, pictures, statues, libraries; in treasury
scribes, in secretaries and under-secretaries of state, of the foreign,
colonial, and war departments, with their swarms of underlings, all of
whom are maintained out of the labour and sweat of the country, and
for all of whom, and for all that they do (put together) the country
is not one pin the better, or at least, one penny more in pocket, than
if they were at the bottom of the Channel. The present may have
been the most just and necessary war, in a political, moral, and
religious point of view, that ever was engaged in; but it has also
been the most expensive; and what is worse, the expense remains
just the same, though it may have been the most unjust and unnecessary
in the world. We have paid for it, and we must pay for
it equally in either case, and wholly out of our own pockets. The
price of restoring the Pope, the Inquisition, the Bourbons, and the
doctrine of Divine Right, is half of our nine hundred millions of
debt. That is the amount of the government bill of costs, presented
to John Bull for payment, not of the principal but the interest; that is
what he has got by the war; the load of taxes at his back, with which
he comes out of his glorious five and twenty years’ struggle, like
Christian’s load of sins, which whether it will not fall off from his
back like Christian’s, into the Slough of Despond, will be seen before
long. The difference between the expense of a war or a peace
establishment is just the difference between a state of productive and
unproductive labour. Now this whole question, which from its
complexity puzzles many people, and has given rise to a great deal
of partly wilful and partly shallow sophistry,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c011'><sup>[20]</sup></a> may be explained in
two words.—Suppose I give a man five shillings a day for going out
in a boat and catching fish for me. This is paying for productive
labour: that is, I give him so much for what he does, or a claim
upon so much of the public stock: but in taking so much from the
stock by laying out his five shillings, he adds so much to it by his
labour, or the disposal of his time in catching fish. But if I, having
the money to do what I please with, give him five shillings a day
for shooting at crows, he is paid equally for his trouble, and
accordingly takes so much from the public stock, while he adds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>nothing to it but so much carrion. So if the government pay him so
much a-day for shooting at Frenchmen and Republicans, this is a tax,
a loss, a burthen to the country, without any thing got by it; for we
cannot, after all, eat Frenchmen and Republicans when we have
killed them. War in itself is a thriving, sensible traffic only to
cannibals! Again—if I give a man five shillings for making a pair
of shoes, this is paying for productive labour, viz. for labour that is
useful, and that must be performed by some one; but if I give the
same man five shillings for standing on his head or behind my chair
while I am picking my teeth, or for running up a hill and down again
for a wager—this is unproductive labour, nothing comes of it, and
though the man who is thus idly employed lives by it, others starve,
upon whose pittance and whose labour he lives through me. Such
is the nature and effect of war; all the energies of which tend to
waste, and to throw an additional and heavy burthen upon the
country, in proportion to the extent and length of time that it is
carried on. It creates so many useless members of the community:
every man paid by the war out of the taxes paid by the people, is,
in fact, a dead body fastened to a living one, that by its weight drags
it to the earth. A five and twenty years’ war, and nine hundred
millions of debt, are really a couple of millstones round the neck of
a country, that must naturally press her down a little in the scale of
prosperity. That seems to be no riddle. We defy any sophist to
answer this statement of the necessary tendency of war in its general
principle to ruin and impoverish a country. We are not to wonder,
when it does so; but when other causes operate to counteract or
retard this tendency. What is extraordinary in our own case is,
that the pernicious effects of war have been delayed so long, not that
they have come upon us at last.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c011'><sup>[21]</sup></a>—That money laid out in war is
thrown away is self-evident from this single circumstance, that
government never refund. The reason is, because they never do
any thing with their money that produces money again. They are
the worst bankers in the world. The Exchequer is a true Sinking
Fund. If you lend money to a farmer, a manufacturer, a merchant,
he employs it in getting something done, for which others will pay,
because it is useful; as in raising corn, in weaving cotton, in bringing
home sugar or tobacco. But money sunk in a war brings in no
returns—except of killed and wounded. What will any one give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the government for the rotten bones that lie buried at Walcheren, or
the dry ones at Waterloo? Not a six-pence. They cannot make a
collection of wooden legs or dangling sleeves from the hospitals at
Greenwich or Chelsea to set up a raffle or a lottery. They cannot
bring the fruits of the war to auction, or put up the tottering throne of
the Bourbons to the best bidder. They can neither bring back a drop
of the blood that has been shed, nor recover a shilling of the treasure
that has been wasted. If the expenses of the war are not a burden
to the people, which must sink it according to their weight, why do
not government take the whole of this thriving concern into their own
hands, and pay the national debt out of the Droits of Admiralty?
In short, the way to ascertain this point is, by the old method of
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</span></i>: Suppose we had to pay the expenses of such
another peace-establishment and such another war. Who does not
see that they would eat up the whole resources of the country, as the
present peace-establishment and actual debt do just one half?</p>

<p class='c010'>The war has wasted the resources of the country in foolery, which
the country has now to pay for in a load of taxes on its remaining
resources, its actual produce and labour. The tax-gatherer is a
government-machine that takes sixty-five millions a-year from the
bankrupt pockets of the nation, to give to those who have brought
it into that situation; who takes so much from the necessaries of
life belonging to the poor, to add to the superfluities of the rich;
who adds so much to the hard labour of the working part of the
community, to ‘relieve the killing languor and over-laboured lassitude
of those who have nothing to do’; who, in short, out of the grinding
poverty and ceaseless toil of those who pay the taxes, enables those
who receive them to live in luxury and idleness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Burke, whom we have just quoted, has said, that ‘if the poor
were to cut the throats of the rich, they would not have a meal the
more for it.’ First, (for truth is the first thing in our thoughts, and
not to give offence the second) this is a falsehood; a greater one
than the answer of a Bond-street lounger, who coming out of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>confectioner’s shop, where he has had a couple of basons of turtle-soup,
an ice, some jellies, and a quantity of pastry, as he saunters out
picking his teeth and putting the change into his pocket, says to a
beggar at the door, ‘I have nothing for you.’ We confess, we have
always felt it an aukward circumstance to be accosted in this manner,
when we have been caught in the act of indulging a sweet tooth, and
it costs us an additional penny. The rich and poor may at present
be compared to the two classes of frequenters of pastry-cooks’ shops,
those on the outside and those on the in. We would seriously
advise the latter, who see the gaunt faces staring at them through
the glass-door, to recollect, that though custard is nicer than bread,
bread is the greatest necessary of the two.—We had forgot Mr.
Burke’s sophism, to which we reply in the second place, that the
cutting of throats is a figure of speech, like the dagger which he
produced in the House of Commons, not necessary to the speculative
decision of the question. The most civil, peaceable, and complaisant
way of putting it is this—whether if the rich were to give all that
they are worth to the poor, the latter would be none the richer for
it? If so, the rich would be none the poorer, and so far could be
no losers on Mr. Burke’s own hypothesis, which supposes, with that
magnanimity of contempt for plain matter of fact which distinguished
the author’s theories, that the rich have nothing, and the poor have
every thing? Had not Mr. Burke a pension of 4000<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> a-year?
Was this nothing? But even this is not the question neither. It is
not, whether if the rich were to part with all they have to the poor
(which is a mere absurdity) but whether if the rich do not take all
they have left from the poor (which we humbly hope is a proposition
that has common sense in it) the latter may not be the better off with
something to live upon than with nothing? Whether, if the whole
load of taxes could be taken off from them, it would not be a relief
to them? Whether, if half the load of taxes were taken off from
them, it would not be a relief to them? Whether, if any part of the
load of taxes that can be taken off from them were taken off, it would
not in the same proportion be a relief to them? We will venture to
say, that no one will deny these propositions who does not receive
so much a year for falsehood and impudence. The resistance which
is made to the general or abstract principle is not intended to prevent
the extreme sweeping application of that principle to the plundering
or (as Mr. Burke will have it) to the cutting the throats of the
rich, but it is a manœuvre, by getting rid of the general principle
altogether, viz. that the extravagance and luxury of the rich,
war, taxes, &amp;c., have a tendency to increase the distresses of the
poor, or measures of retrenchment and reform to lighten those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>distresses—to give <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte-blanche</span></i> to the government to squander the
wealth, the blood, the happiness of the nation at pleasure; to grant
jobs, places, pensions, sinecures, reversions without end, to grind
down, to starve and impoverish the country with systematic impunity.
It is a legerdemain trick played off by hireling politicians, to enable
their patrons and employers to pick our pockets and laugh in our
faces at the same time.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been said by such persons that taxes are not a burthen to
the country; that the wealth collected in taxes returns through those
who receive to those who pay them, only divided more equally and
beneficially among all parties, just (they say) as the vapours and
moisture of the earth collected in the clouds return to enrich the soil
in soft and fertilizing showers. We shall set ourselves to shew that
this is not true.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suppose a society of ten persons, without taxes to pay, and who
live on their own labour, on the produce of the ground, and the
exchange of one commodity among themselves for another. Some
of these persons will be naturally employed in tilling the ground,
others in tending cattle, others, in making instruments of husbandry,
others in weaving cloth, others in making shoes, others in building
houses, others in making roads, others in buying and selling, others
in fetching and carrying what the others want. All will be employed
in something that they want themselves, or that others want. In
such a state of society, nothing will be given for nothing. If a man
has a bushel of wheat, and only wants half of it, he will give the
other half to some one, for making him a coat or a pair of shoes. As
every one will be paid for what he does out of the earnings of the labour
of others, no one will waste his time or his strength in doing any thing
that is not wanted by some one else, that is not as useful and necessary,
to his subsistence and comfort, and more so, than the commodity
which he gives in exchange for it. There will be no unproductive
labour. What each person gets will be either in proportion to what
he has done for himself, or what he has added to the comforts of
others. Exchange there will be no robbery. The wealth of all
will be the result of the exertions of each individual, and will
circulate equally and beneficially, because those who produce that
wealth will share it among themselves. This is an untaxed state of
society, where wealth changes hands indeed, but finds its level,
notwithstanding.—Now suppose two other individuals to be fastened
upon this society of ten persons—a government-man and a fund-holder.
They change the face of it in an instant. The equilibrium,
the balance is upset. The amount of the wealth of the society before
was a thousand pounds a-year, suppose. The two new-comers take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>a writ out of their pockets, by which they quietly lay hands on five
hundred of it as their fair portion. Where are the ten persons now?
Mr. Burke, Mr. Coleridge, Mr. Vansittart, <cite>The Courier</cite>, say—Just
where they were before! We say, No such thing. For three
reasons: 1. It cannot be denied that the interlopers, the government-man
and his friend, the fund-holder, who has lent him money to
sport with on all occasions, are substantial <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> persons, like other
men, who live by eating, drinking, &amp;c., and who, if they only
shared equally with the other ten what they had got amongst them,
(for they add nothing to the common stock) must be a sufficient
burthen upon the rest, that is, must diminish the comforts or increase
the labour of each person one-fifth. To hear the other side talk, one
would suppose that those who raise and are paid out of the taxes
never touch a farthing of them, that they have no occasion for them,
that they neither eat nor drink, nor buy clothing, or build houses
with them; that they live upon air, or that harmless food, bank
notes (a thing not to speak of), and that all the money they are so
anxious to collect is distributed by them again for the sole benefit of
others, or passes back through the Exchequer, as if it were a conduit-pipe
or empty tunnel, into the hands of the original proprietors,
without diminution or diversion. Now this is not so. 2. Not only
do our government-man and his friend live like other people upon
their means, but they live better than other people, for they have
better means, that is, these two take half of what the other ten get.
They would be fools if they gave it back to them; no, depend upon
it, they lay out their five hundred a-year upon themselves, for their own
sole use, benefit, pleasure, mirth, and pastime. For each of these
gentlemen has just five times as much to spend as any of those that
he lives upon at free cost, and he has nothing to do but to think how
he shall spend it. He eats and drinks as much as he can, and
always of the best and most costly. It is pretended that the
difference in the consumption of the produce of the soil is little or
nothing, for a poor man’s belly will hold as much as a rich man’s.
But not if the one is full and the other empty. The man who lives
upon the taxes, feasts upon venison and turtle, and crams himself to
the throat with fish, flesh, and fowl; the man who pays the taxes,
upon a crust of mouldy bread, and fat rusty bacon: the man who
receives the taxes drinks rich and sparkling wines, hock and canary;
the man who pays them, sour small beer. If the poor man gets
drunk and leads an idle life, his family starve: the rich man drinks
his three bottles a day and does nothing, while his family live on
the fat of the land. If the poor man dies of hard labour and poor
living, his family comes to the parish; if the rich man dies of hard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>living and want of exercise, he leaves his family to be provided for
by the state. But, 3. All that the government-man and the fund-holder
do not spend upon their bellies, in revelling and gormandising,
they lay out upon their backs, their houses, their carriages, &amp;c., in
inordinate demands upon the labour of the former ten persons, who
are now employed, not in working for one another, but in pampering
the pride, ostentation, vanity, folly, or vices, of our two gentlemen
comers. After glutting their physical appetites, they take care to
apply all the rest to the gratification of their factitious, arbitrary, and
fantastic wants, which are unlimited, and which the universe could
not supply. ‘They toil not, neither do they spin, and yet even
Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these:’—while
the poor are clothed in rags, and the dogs lick up their sores. The
money that is taken from you and me, or the more industrious
members of the community, and that we should have laid out in
having snug, comfortable houses built for us all, or two bed-rooms for
our families instead of one, is employed, now that it has got into the
tax-gatherer’s hands, in hiring the same persons to build two enormous
houses for the government-man and the fund-holder, who live in
palaces while we live in hovels. What are we, the people, the
original ten men, the better for that? The taxes enable those who
receive them to pay our masons, carpenters, &amp;c., for working for
them. If we had not been forced to pay the money in taxes, the
same persons would have been employed by us for our common
benefit. Suppose the government-man takes it into his head to build
a colossus, a rotunda, a pyramid, or anything else equally absurd and
gigantic, it would, we say, be a nuisance in proportion to its size. It
would be ten times as great a nuisance if it was ten times bigger. If
it covered a whole county, it would ruin the landed interest. If it
was spread over the whole country, the country must starve. When the
government-man and the fund-holder have got their great houses built,
they must next have them furnished with proportionable magnificence,
and by the same means; with Persian and Turkey carpets, with
Egyptian sofas, down beds, silk curtains, china vases, services of plate,
tables, chairs, stoves, glasses, mirrors, chandeliers, paper hangings,
pictures, busts, ornaments, kickshaws without number, while you and
I live on a mud floor, with bare walls, stuck with a penny ballad, with
a joint-stool to sit upon, a tea-pot without a tea-spout to drink out of,
a truckle-bed or some straw and a blanket to lie upon! Yet Mr.
Burke says, that if we were suddenly converted into state-pensioners
with thirty-thousand a year, we could not furnish our houses a bit the
better for it. This is like Lord Peter, in the Tale of a Tub. Then
the government-man and his friend must have their train of coaches,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>horses, dogs, footmen dressed in blue, green, yellow, and red, lazy
rascals, making work for the taylor, the hatter, the shoemaker, the
button-maker, the hair-dresser, the gold and silver laceman, to powder,
dress, and trick them out, that they may lounge behind their mistresses’
coaches, walk before their sedan chairs, help on their master’s stockings,
block up his doors, and perform a variety of little nameless
offices, much to the ease and satisfaction of the great, but not of the
smallest benefit to any one else. With respect to the article of dogs
and horses, a word in Mr. Malthus’s ear. They come under the
head of consumption, and a swinging item they are. They eat up
the food of the children of the poor. The pleasure and coach-horses
kept in this kingdom consume as much of the produce of the soil as
would maintain all the paupers in it. Let a tax be laid upon them
directly, to defray the expense of the poor-rates, and to suspend the
operation of Mr. Malthus’s geometrical and arithmetical ratios. We
see no physical necessity why that ingenious divine should put a stop
to the propagation of the species, that he may keep two sleek geldings
in his stable. We have lately read Swift’s account of the Houynhyms
and Yahoos. There is some truth in it; but still it has not reconciled
us to Mr. Malthus’s proposal of starving the children of the poor to
feed the horses of the rich. But no more of that! We have said
enough at present to shew how the taxes fly away with the money of
a nation; how they go into the hands of the government-man and the
fund-holder, and do not return into the pockets of the people, who
pay them. For the future, Mr. Burke’s assertion, that the taxes
are like the vapours that ascend into the clouds and return to the
earth in fertilizing showers, may pass for an agreeable metaphor, but
for nothing more. A pretty joke truly, this, of the people’s receiving
their taxes back again in payment for what the rich want of them.
It is as if I should buy a pound of beef in a butcher’s shop, and take
the money out of his own till to pay him! It is as if a bill is
presented to me for payment, and I ask the notary for the money to
take it up with! It is as if a Noble Earl was to win 50,000<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> of a
Noble Duke over-night, and offer to return it to him the next morning,
for one of his estates! It is as if Mr. Burke had been robbed of a
bond for 4000<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> and the fortunate possessor had offered to restore it,
on receiving in lieu his house and gardens at Beaconsfield! Having
thus pointed out the nature of the distress, we need not inquire far for
the remedy.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Lay-Sermon puts us in mind of Mahomet’s coffin, which was
suspended between heaven and earth, or of the flying island at
Laputa, which hovered over the head of Gulliver. The ingenious
author, in a preface, which is a masterpiece in its kind, having neither
beginning, middle, nor end, apologizes for having published a work,
not a line of which is written, or ever likely to be written. He has,
it seems, resorted to this expedient as the only way of appearing
before the public in a manner worthy of himself and his genius, and
descants on the several advantages to be derived from this original
mode of composition;—That as long as he does not put pen to paper,
the first sentence cannot contradict the second; that neither his
reasonings nor his conclusions can be liable to objection, <em>in the abstract</em>;
that <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omne ignotum pro magnifico est</span></i>, is an axiom laid down by some of
the best and wisest men of antiquity; that hitherto his performance,
in the opinion of his readers, has fallen short of the vastness of his
designs, but that no one can find fault with what he does not write;
that while he merely haunts the public imagination with obscure noises,
or by announcing his spiritual appearance for the next week, and does
not venture out <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propria persona</span></i> with his shroud and surplice on, the
Cock-lane Ghost of mid-day, he may escape in a whole skin without
being handled by the mob, or uncased by the critics; and he considers
it the safest way to keep up the importance of his oracular communications,
by letting them remain a profound secret both to himself and
the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this instance, we think the writer’s modesty has led him into a
degree of unnecessary precaution. We see no sort of difference
between his published and his unpublished compositions. It is just as
impossible to get at the meaning of the one as the other. No man ever
yet gave Mr. Coleridge ‘a penny for his thoughts.’ His are all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>maiden ideas; immaculate conceptions. He is the ‘Secret Tattle’ of
the press. Each several work exists only in the imagination of the
author, and is quite inaccessible to the understandings of his readers—‘Yet
virgin of Proserpina from Jove.’—We can give just as good
a guess at the design of this Lay-Sermon, which is not published, as
of <cite>the Friend</cite>, the Preliminary Articles in <cite>the Courier</cite>, <cite>the Watchman</cite>,
<cite>the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conciones ad Populum</span></cite>, or any of the other courtly or popular
publications of the same author. Let the experiment be tried, and if,
on committing the manuscript to the press, the author is caught in the
fact of a single intelligible passage, we will be answerable for Mr.
Coleridge’s loss of character. But we know the force of his genius
too well. What is his <cite>Friend</cite> itself but an enormous title-page; the
longest and most tiresome prospectus that ever was written; an endless
preface to an imaginary work; a table of contents that fills the whole
volume; a huge bill of fare of all possible subjects, with not an idea
to be had for love or money? One number consists of a grave-faced
promise to perform something impossible in the next; and the next is
taken up with a long-faced apology for not having done it. Through
the whole of this work, Mr. Coleridge appears in the character of
the Unborn Doctor; the very Barmecide of knowledge; the Prince
of preparatory authors!</p>

<p class='c013'>He is the Dog in the Manger of literature, an intellectual Mar-Plot,
who will neither let any body else come to a conclusion, nor come to
one himself.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c011'><sup>[23]</sup></a> This gentleman belongs to the class of eclectic philosophers;
but whereas they professed to examine different systems, in
order to select what was good in each, our perverse critic ransacks all
past or present theories, to pick out their absurdities, and to abuse
whatever is good in them. He takes his notions of religion from the
‘sublime piety’ of Jordano Bruno, and considers a belief in a God as
a very subordinate question to the worship of the Three Persons of
the Trinity. The thirty-nine articles and St. Athanasius’s creed are,
upon the same principle, much more fundamental parts of the Christian
religion than the miracles or gospel of Christ. He makes the
essence of devotion to consist in Atheism, the perfection of morality
in a total disregard of consequences. He refers the great excellence
of the British Constitution to the prerogative of the Crown, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>conceives that the old French Constitution must have been admirably
defended by the States-General, which never met, from the abuses of
arbitrary power. He highly approves of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</span></i> informations and
special juries, as the great bulwarks of the liberty of the press; taxes
he holds to be a providential relief to the distresses of the people, and
war to be a state of greater security than peace. He defines
Jacobinism to be an abstract attachment to liberty, truth, and justice;
and finding that this principle has been abused or carried to excess,
he argues that Anti-jacobinism, or the abstract principles of despotism,
superstition, and oppression, are the safe, sure, and undeniable remedy
for the former, and the only means of restoring liberty, truth, and
justice in the world. Again, he places the seat of truth in <em>the heart</em>,
of virtue in <em>the head</em>; damns a tragedy as shocking that draws tears
from the audience, and pronounces a comedy to be inimitable, if
nobody laughs at it; labours to unsettle the plainest things by far-fetched
sophistry, and makes up for the want of proof in matters of
fact by the mechanical operations of the spirit. He judges of men as
he does of things. He would persuade you that Sir Isaac Newton
was a money-scrivener, Voltaire dull, Bonaparte a poor creature, and
the late Mr. Howard a misanthrope; while he pays a willing homage
to the Illustrious Obscure, of whom he always carries a list in his
pocket. His creed is formed not from a distrust and disavowal of
the exploded errors of other systems, but from a determined rejection
of their acknowledged excellences. It is a transposition of reason
and common sense. He adopts all the vulnerable points of belief as
the triumphs of his fastidious philosophy, and holds a general retainer
for the defence of all contradictions in terms and impossibilities in
practice. He is at cross-purposes with himself as well as others, and
discards his own caprices if ever he suspects there is the least ground
for them. Doubt succeeds to doubt, cloud rolls over cloud, one
paradox is driven out by another still greater, in endless succession.
He is equally averse to the prejudices of the vulgar, the paradoxes of
the learned, or the habitual convictions of his own mind. He moves
in an unaccountable diagonal between truth and falsehood, sense and
nonsense, sophistry and common-place, and only assents to any opinion
when he knows that all the reasons are against it. A matter of fact
is abhorrent to his nature: the very <em>air</em> of truth repels him. He is
only saved from the extremities of absurdity by combining them all
in his own person. Two things are indispensable to him—to set out
from no premises, and to arrive at no conclusion. The consciousness
of a single certainty would be an insupportable weight upon his mind.
He slides out of a logical deduction by the help of metaphysics: and
if the labyrinths of metaphysics did not afford him ‘ample scope and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>verge enough,’ he would resort to necromancy and the cabbala. He
only tolerates the science of astronomy for the sake of its connection
with the dreams of judicial astrology, and escapes from the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principia</span></cite>
of Newton to the jargon of Lily and Ashmole. All his notions are
floating and unfixed, like what is feigned of the first forms of things
flying about in search of bodies to attach themselves to; but <em>his</em> ideas
seek to avoid all contact with solid substances. Innumerable evanescent
thoughts dance before him, and dazzle his sight, like insects in
the evening sun. Truth is to him a ceaseless round of contradictions:
he lives in the belief of a perpetual lie, and in affecting to think what
he pretends to say. His mind is in a constant estate of flux and
reflux: he is like the Sea-horse in the Ocean; he is the Man in the
Moon, the Wandering Jew.—The reason of all this is, that Mr.
Coleridge has great powers of thought and fancy, without will or
sense. He is without a strong feeling of the existence of any thing
out of himself; and he has neither purposes nor passions of his own
to make him wish it to be. All that he does or thinks is involuntary;
even his perversity and self-will are so. They are nothing but a
necessity of yielding to the slightest motive. Everlasting inconsequentiality
marks all that he attempts. All his impulses are loose,
airy, devious, casual. The strongest of his purposes is lighter than
the gossamer, ‘that wantons in the idle summer-air’: the brightest of
his schemes a bubble blown by an infant’s breath, that rises, glitters,
bursts in the same instant:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Or like the Borealis race,</div>
      <div class='line'>That flit ere you can mark their place:</div>
      <div class='line'>Or like the snow falls in the river,</div>
      <div class='line'>A moment white, then gone for ever.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>His mind has infinite activity, which only leads him into numberless
chimeras; and infinite resources, which not being under the guidance
of his will, only distract and perplex him. His genius has angel’s
wings; but neither hands nor feet. He soars up to heaven, circles
the empyrean, or dives to the centre of the earth, but he neither lays
his hands upon the treasures of the one, nor can find a resting place for
his feet in the other. He is no sooner borne to the utmost point of
his ambition, than he is hurried away from it again by the same
fantastic impulse, or his own specific levity. He has all the faculties
of the human mind but one, and yet without that one, the rest only
impede and interfere with each other—‘Like to a man on double
business bound who both neglects.’ He would have done better if
he had known less. His imagination thus becomes metaphysical, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>metaphysics fantastical, his wit heavy, his arguments light, his poetry
prose, his prose poetry, his politics turned—but not to account. He
belongs to all parties and is of service to none. He gives up his
independence of mind, and yet does not acquire independence of
fortune. He offends others without satisfying himself, and equally by
his servility and singularity, shocks the prejudices of all about him.
If he had had but common moral principle, that is, sincerity, he
would have been a great man; nor hardly, as it is, appears to us—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Less than arch-angel ruined, and the excess</div>
      <div class='line'>Of glory obscur’d.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We lose our patience when we think of the powers that he has wasted,
and compare them and their success with those, for instance, of such
a fellow as the ——, all whose ideas, notions, apprehensions, comprehensions,
feelings, virtues, genius, skill, are comprised in the two
words which <em>Peachum</em> describes as necessary qualifications in his gang,
‘To stand himself and bid others stand!’</p>

<p class='c010'>When his six Irish friends, the six Irish gentlemen, Mr. Makins,
Mr. Dunkley, Mr. Monaghan, Mr. Gollogher, Mr. Gallaspy, and
Mr. O’Keeffe, after an absence of several years, discovered their old
acquaintance John Buncle, sitting in a mixed company at Harrowgate
Wells, they exclaimed with one accord—‘There he is—making love
to the finest woman in the universe!’ So we may say at a venture
of Mr. Coleridge—‘There he is, at this instant (no matter where)
talking away among his gossips, as if he were at the Court of
Semiramis, with the Sophi or Prestor John.’ The place can never
reach the height of his argument. He should live in a world of
enchantment, that things might answer to his descriptions. His talk
would suit the miracle of the Conversion of Constantine, or Raphael’s
Assembly of the Just. It is not short of that. His face would cut
no figure there, but his tongue would wag to some purpose. He is
fit to take up the deep pauses of conversation between Cardinals and
Angels—his cue would not be wanting in presence of the beatific
vision. Let him talk on for ever in this world and the next; and
both worlds will be the better for it. But let him not write, or
pretend to write, nonsense. Nobody is the better for it. It was
a fine thought in Mr. Wordsworth to represent Cervantes at the day
of judgment and conflagration of the world carrying off the romance
of Don Quixote under his arm. We hope that Mr. Coleridge, on
the same occasion, will leave ‘the Friend’ to take its chance, and his
‘Lay Sermon’ to get up into the Limbo of Vanity, how it can.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Here is the true Simon Pure. We have by anticipation given some
account of this Sermon. We have only to proceed to specimens in
illustration of what we have said.</p>

<p class='c010'>It sets out with the following sentence:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘If our own knowledge and information concerning the Bible
had been confined to the one fact of its immediate derivation from
God, we should still presume that it contained rules and assistances
for all conditions of men under all circumstances; and therefore for
communities no less than for individuals.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Now this is well said; ‘and ’tis a kind of good deed to say well.’
But why did not Mr. Coleridge keep on in the same strain to the
end of the chapter, instead of himself disturbing the harmony and
unanimity which he here very properly supposes to exist on this
subject, or questioning the motives of its existence by such passages
as the following, p. 23 of the Appendix:</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Thank heaven! notwithstanding the attempts of Mr. Thomas
Paine and his compeers, it is not so bad with us. <em>Open infidelity</em> has
ceased to be a means even of gratifying vanity; for the leaders of
the gang themselves turned apostates to Satan, as soon as the number
of their proselytes became <em>so large</em>, that Atheism ceased to give
distinction. Nay, it became a mark of original thinking to defend
the Belief and the Ten Commandments; so the <em>strong minds</em> veered
round, and religion came again into fashion.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Now we confess we do not find in this statement much to thank
heaven for; if religion has only come into fashion again with the
strong minds—(it will hardly be denied that Mr. Coleridge is one
of the number)—as a better mode of gratifying their vanity than
‘open infidelity.’ Be this as it may, Mr. Coleridge has here given
a true and masterly delineation of that large class of Proselytes or
their teachers, who believe any thing or nothing, just as their vanity
prompts them. All that we have ever said of modern apostates is
poor and feeble to it. There is however one error in his statement,
inasmuch as Mr. Thomas Paine never openly professed Atheism,
whatever some of his compeers might do.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a pity that with all that fund of ‘rules and assistances’ which
the Bible contains for our instruction and reproof, and which the
author in this work proposes to recommend as the Statesman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Manual, or the best Guide to Political Skill and Foresight, in times
like these, he has not brought forward a single illustration of his
doctrine, nor referred to a single example in the Jewish history that
bears at all, in the circumstances, or the inference, on our own, but
one, and that one he has purposely omitted. Is this to be credited?
Not without quoting the passage.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘But do you require some one or more particular passage from
the Bible that may at once illustrate and exemplify its application to
the changes and fortunes of empires? Of the numerous chapters
that relate to the Jewish tribes, their enemies and allies, before and
after their division into two kingdoms, it would be more difficult to
state a single one, from which some guiding light might <em>not</em> be struck.’
[Oh, very well, we shall have a few of them. The passage goes on.]
‘And in nothing is Scriptural history more strongly contrasted with
the histories of highest note in the present age, than in its freedom
from the hollowness of abstractions.’ [Mr. Coleridge’s admiration
of the inspired writers seems to be very much mixed with a dislike
of Hume and Gibbon.]—‘While the latter present a shadow-fight of
Things and Quantities, the former gives us the history of Men, and
balances the important influence of individual minds with the previous
state of national morals and manners, in which, as constituting a
specific susceptibility, it presents to us the true cause, both of the
influence itself, and of the Weal or Woe that were its consequents.
<em>How should it be otherwise?</em> The histories and political economy of
the present and preceding century partake in the general contagion
of its mechanic philosophy.’ [“still harping on my daughter”] ‘and
are the <em>product</em> of an unenlivened generalizing understanding. In
the Scriptures they are the living <em>educts</em> of the Imagination; of that
reconciling and mediatory power, which incorporating the reason in
Images of the Sense, and organising (as it were) the flux of the
Senses by the permanence and self-circling energies of the Reason,
gives birth to a system of symbols, harmonious in themselves, and
consubstantial with the truths, of which they are the <em>conductors</em>.
These are the Wheels which Ezekiel beheld when the hand of the
Lord was upon him, and he saw visions of God as he sat among
the captives by the river of Chebar. <em>Whither soever the Spirit was
to go, the wheels went, and thither was their spirit to go; for the
spirit of the living creature was in the wheels also.</em> The truths and
the symbols that represent them move in conjunction, and form the
living chariot that bears up (for us) the throne of the Divine
Humanity. <em>Hence by a derivative, indeed, but not a divided influence,
and though in a secondary, yet in more than a metaphorical sense, the
Sacred Book</em> is worthily entitled the Word of God,’ p. 36.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>So that, after all, the Bible is not the immediate word of God,
except according to the German philosophy, and <em>in something between
a literal and metaphorical sense</em>. Of all the cants that ever were
canted in this canting world, this is the worst! The author goes on
to add, that ‘it is among the miseries of the present age that it
recognises no medium between <em>literal</em> and <em>metaphorical</em>,’ and laments
that ‘the mechanical understanding, in the blindness of its self-complacency,
confounds <span class='sc'>Symbols</span> with <span class='sc'>Allegories</span>.’—This is
certainly a sad mistake, which he labours very learnedly to set right,
‘in a diagonal sidelong movement between truth and falsehood.’—We
assure the reader that the passages which we have given above
are given in the order in which they are strung together in the
Sermon; and so he goes on for several pages, concluding his career
where the Allies have concluded theirs, with the doctrine of Divine
Right; which he does not however establish quite so successfully
with the pen, as they have done with the sword. ‘Herein’ (says
this profound writer) ‘the Bible differs from all the books of Greek
philosophy, and in a two-fold manner. It doth not affirm a Divine
Nature only, but a God; and not a God only, but the living God.
<em>Hence in the Scriptures alone is the</em> <span class='sc'>Jus Divinum</span> <em>or direct Relation of
the State and its Magistracy to the Supreme Being, taught as a vital
and indispensable part of</em> <span class='fss'>ALL MORAL AND ALL POLITICAL WISDOM</span>, <em>even as
the Jewish alone was a true theocracy!</em>’</p>

<p class='c010'>Now it does appear to us, that as the reason why the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus Divinum</span></i>
was taught in the Jewish state was, that that alone was a true
theocracy, this is so far from proving this doctrine to be a <em>part of all
moral and all political wisdom</em>, that it proves just the contrary. This
may perhaps be owing to our mechanical understanding. Wherever
Mr. C. will shew us the theocracy, we will grant him the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus
Divinum</span></i>. Where God really pulls down and sets up kings, the
people need not do it. Under the true Jewish theocracy, the priests
and prophets cashiered kings; but our lay-preacher will hardly take
this office upon himself as a part of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus Divinum</span></i>, without having
any thing better to shew for it than his profound moral and political
wisdom. Mr. Southey hints at something of the kind in verse, and
we are not sure that Mr. Coleridge does not hint at it in prose.
For after his extraordinary career and interminable circumnavigation
through the heaven of heavens, after being wrapt in the wheels of
Ezekiel, and sitting with the captives by the river of Chebar,
he lights once more on English ground, and you think you have
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘But I refer to the demand. Were it my object to touch on
the present state of public affairs in this kingdom, or on the prospective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>measures in agitation respecting our Sister Island, I would
direct your most serious meditations to the latter period of the
reign of Solomon, and the revolutions in the reign of Rehoboam his
son. <em>But I tread on glowing embers.</em> I will turn to a subject on
which all men of reflection are at length in agreement—the causes of
the Revolution and fearful chastisement of France.’—Here Mr.
Coleridge is off again on the wings of fear as he was before on those
of fancy.—This trifling can only be compared to that of the
impertinent barber of Bagdad, who being sent for to shave the prince,
spent the whole morning in preparing his razors, took the height of
the sun with an astrolabe, sung the song of Zimri, and danced the
dance of Zamtout, and concluded by declining to perform the
operation at all, because the day was unfavourable to its success. As
we are not so squeamish as Mr. Coleridge, and do not agree with
him and all other men of reflection on the subject of the French
Revolution, we shall turn back to the latter end of the reign of
Solomon, and that of his successor Rehoboam, to find out the parallel
to the present reign and regency which so particularly strikes and
startles Mr. Coleridge.—Here it is for the edification of the curious,
from the First Book of Kings:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And the time that Solomon reigned over all Israel was forty
years. And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
And Rehoboam went to Shechem: <em>for all Israel were come to Shechem
to make him king</em>.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c011'><sup>[24]</sup></a> And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel
came and spake unto Rehoboam, saying, Thy father (Solomon) made
our yoke grievous; now, therefore, make thou the grievous service of
thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, <em>and we
will serve thee</em>. And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days,
then come again to me. And the people departed. And King
Rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before Solomon his
father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise, that I may
answer this people? And they spake unto him, saying, <em>If thou wilt
be a servant unto this people</em> this day, and wilt serve them, and answer
them, and speak good words unto them, <em>then</em> they will be thy servants
for ever. But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they
had given him, <em>and consulted with the young men that were grown up
with him, and which stood before him</em>: And he said unto them, What
counsel give ye, that we may answer this people, who have spoken to
me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?
And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee,
saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter
unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, <em>My little finger shall be thicker
than my father’s loins. And now, whereas my father did lade you with
a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you
with whips: but I will chastise you with scorpions.</em> So Jeroboam and
all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had
appointed, saying, come to me again the third day. And the king
<em>answered the people roughly</em>, and forsook the old men’s counsel that
they gave him: And spake to them after the counsel of the young
men, saying, <em>My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your
yoke; my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you
with scorpions.</em> Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people;
<em>for the cause was from the Lord</em>, that he might perform his saying
which the Lord spake by Ahijah, the Shilonite, unto Jeroboam the
son of Nebat.’ [We here see pretty plainly how the principle of ‘a
true theocracy’ qualified the doctrine of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus Divinum</span></i> among the
Jews; but let us mark the sequel.] ‘<em>So when all Israel saw that the
King hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What
portion have we in David: neither have we inheritance in the son of
Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David.
So Israel departed unto their tents.</em> Then king Rehoboam sent
Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with
stones that he died; therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get
him up to his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. So Israel rebelled against
the house of David unto this day. And it came to pass when all
Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called
him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is the doctrine and practice of divine right, with a vengeance.
We do not wonder Mr. Coleridge was shy of instances from his
Statesman’s Manual, as the rest are like this. He does not say
(neither shall we, for we are not salamanders any more than he,
<em>to tread on glowing embers</em>) whether he approves of the conduct of all
Israel in this case, or of the <em>grand</em>, <em>magnificent</em>, <em>and gracious</em> answer of
the son of Solomon; but this we will say, that his bringing or
alluding to a passage like this immediately after his <em>inuendo</em> (addressed
to the higher classes) that the doctrine of divine right is contained
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</span></i> in the Scriptures alone, is we should suppose, an instance
of a power of voluntary self-delusion, and of a delight in exercising it
on the most ticklish topics, greater than ever was or ever will be
possessed by any other individual that ever did or ever will live upon
the face of the earth. ‘Imposture, organised into a comprehensive
and self-consistent whole, forms a world of its own, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>inversion becomes the order of nature.’ Compared with such powers
of inconceivable mental refinement, hypocrisy is a great baby, a
shallow dolt, a gross dunce, a clumsy devil!</p>

<p class='c010'>Among other passages, unrivalled in style and matter by any other
author, take the following:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘When I named this Essay a Sermon, I sought to prepare the
inquirers after it for the absence of all the usual softenings <em>suggested
by worldly prudence</em>, of all compromise between truth and courtesy.
But not even as a Sermon would I have addressed the present
Discourse to a promiscuous audience: and for this reason I likewise
announced it in the title-page, as exclusively <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad clerum</span></i>, i.e. (in the
old and wide sense of the word<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c011'><sup>[25]</sup></a>) to men of <em>clerkly</em> acquirements, of
whatever profession.’ [All that we know is, that there is no such
title-page to our copy.] ‘I would that the greater part of our
publications could be thus <em>directed</em>, each to its appropriate class of
readers. But this cannot be! For among other odd burs and kecksies,
the misgrowth of our luxuriant activity, we have a <span class='sc'>Reading Public</span>,
as strange <em>a phrase</em>, methinks, as ever forced a splenetic smile on the
staid countenance of meditation; and yet <em>no fiction</em>! For our readers
have, in good truth, multiplied exceedingly, and have waxed proud.
It would require the <em>intrepid accuracy</em> of a Colquhoun’—[Intrepid
and accurate applied to a Colquhoun! It seems that whenever an
objection in matter of fact occurs to our author’s mind, he instinctively
applies the flattering unction of words to smooth it over to his
conscience, as you apply a salve to a sore]—‘to venture at the
precise number of that vast company only, whose heads and hearts
are dieted at the two public <em>ordinaries</em> of literature, the circulating
libraries and the periodical press. But what is the result? Does
the <em>inward man</em> thrive on this regimen? Alas! if the average health
of the consumers may be judged of by the articles of largest consumption’—[Is
not this a side-blow at the <cite>Times</cite> and <cite>Courier</cite>?]—‘if
the secretions may be conjectured from the ingredients of the dishes
that are found best suited to their palates; from all that I have seen,
either of the banquet or the guests, I shall utter my <em>profaccia</em>’—[‘Oh
thou particular fellow!‘]—‘with a desponding sigh: From a
popular philosophy, and philosophic populace, good sense deliver us!’</p>

<p class='c010'>Why so, any more than from a popular religion or a religious
populace, on Mr. Coleridge’s own principle, p. 12, ‘Reason and
religion are their own evidence’? We should suspect that our unread
author, the ‘Secret Tattle’ of the Press, is thus fastidious, because
he keeps an ordinary himself which is not frequented. He professes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>to be select: but we all know the secret of ‘seminaries for a limited
number of pupils.’ Mr. Coleridge addresses his Lay-Sermon ‘to
the higher classes,’ in his printed title-page: in that which is not
printed he has announced it to be <i>directed <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad clerum</span></i>, which might
imply the clergy, but no: he issues another <span class='fss'>EXTENT</span> for the benefit of
the Reading Public, and says he means by the annunciation <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad clerum</span></i>,
all persons of clerkly acquirements, that is, who can read and write.
What wretched stuff is all this! We well remember a friend of his
and ours saying, many years ago, on seeing a little shabby volume of
<em>Thomson’s Seasons</em> lying in the window of a solitary ale-house, at the
top of a rock hanging over the British Channel,—‘<em>That is true fame!</em>’
If he were to write fifty Lay-Sermons, he could not answer the
inference from this one sentence, which is, that there are books that
make their way wherever there are readers, and that there ought
every where to be readers for such books!</p>

<p class='c010'>To the words <span class='sc'>Reading Public</span>, in the above passage, is the
following note, which in wit and humour does not fall short of Mr.
Southey’s ‘Tract on the Madras System’:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Some participle passive in the diminutive form, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">eruditorum natio</span></i>
for instance, might seem at first sight a fuller and more exact
designation: but the superior force and humour of the former
become evident whenever the phrase occurs, as a step or stair in
the climax of irony.... Among the revolutions worthy of notice,
the change in the introductory sentences and prefatory matter in
serious books is not the least striking. The same gross flattery,
which disgusts us in the dedications to individuals, in the elder
writers, is now transferred to the nation at large, or the <span class='sc'>Reading
Public</span>; while the Jeremiads of our old moralists, and their angry
denunciations against the ignorance, immorality, and irreligion of the
<em>people</em> appear (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutatis mutandis</span></i>, and with an appeal to the worst
passions, envy, discontent, scorn, vindictiveness,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c011'><sup>[26]</sup></a> &amp;c.) in the shape
of bitter libels on ministers, parliament, the clergy; in short, on the
state and church, and all persons employed in them. Likewise,
I would point out to the reader’s attention the marvellous predominance
at present of the words, <em>Idea</em> and Demonstration. Every
talker now-a-days has an Idea; aye, and he will demonstrate it too!
A few days ago, I heard one of the <span class='sc'>Reading Public</span>, a thinking
and independent smuggler, euphonise the latter word with much
significance, in a tirade against the planners of the late African
expedition: “<em>As to Algiers, any man that has half an</em> <span class='sc'>Idea</span> <em>in his skull
must know, that it has been long ago dey-monstered, I should say, dey-monstrified</em>,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">&amp;c.</span></i> But the phrase, which occasioned this note, brings
to my mind the mistake of a lethargic Dutch traveller, who, returning
highly gratified from a showman’s caravan, which he had been
tempted to enter by the words <span class='sc'>Learned Pig</span>, gilt on the pannels, met
another caravan of a similar shape, with the <span class='sc'>Reading Fly</span> on it, in
letters of the same size and splendour. “Why, dis is voonders above
voonders,” exclaims the Dutchman, takes his seat as first comer, and
soon fatigued by waiting, and by the very hush and intensity of his
expectation, gives way to his constitutional somnolence, from which
he is roused by the supposed showman at Hounslow, with a “<em>In
what name, Sir, was your place taken? are you booked all the
way for Reading?</em>” Now a Reading Public is (to my mind)
more marvellous still, and in the third tier of “Voonders above
voonders.“‘</p>

<p class='c010'>A public that could read such stuff as this with any patience
would indeed be so. We do not understand how, with this
systematic antipathy to the Reading Public, it is consistent in
Mr. Coleridge to declare of ‘Dr. Bell’s original and unsophisticated
plan,’ that he ‘himself regards it as an especial gift of
Providence to the human race, as an incomparable machine, a vast
moral steam-engine.’ Learning is an old University mistress, that
he is not willing to part with, except for the use of the church
of England; and he is sadly afraid she should be debauched by
the ‘liberal ideas’ of Joseph Lancaster! As to his aversion to the
prostitution of the word <em>Idea</em> to common uses and in common minds,
it is no wonder, from the very exalted <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">idea</span></i> which he has given us of
this term.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What other measures I had in contemplation it has been my
endeavour to explain elsewhere.... O what treasures of practical
wisdom would be once more brought into open day by the solution
of this problem,’ to wit, ‘a thorough recasting of the moulds in
which the minds of our gentry, the characters of our future land-owners,
magistrates, and senators, are to receive their shape and
fashion. Suffice it for the present to hint the master-thought. <em>The
first man, on whom the light of an <span class='sc'>Idea</span> dawned did in that same
moment receive the spirit and the credentials of a Lawgiver</em>; and as
long as man shall exist, so long will the possession of that antecedent
knowledge which exists only in the power of an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">idea</span></i>, be the one
lawful qualification for all dominion in the world of the senses,’
p. 52. Now we do think this a shorter cut towards the undermining
of the rotten boroughs, and ousting the present ministry, than
any we have yet heard of. One of the most extraordinary ideas in
this work is where the Author proves the doctrine of free will from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>the existence of property; and again, when he recommends the study
of the Scriptures, from the example of Heraclitus and Horace. To
conclude this most inconclusive piece of work, we find the distant
hopes and doubtful expectations of the writer’s mind summed up
in the following rare rhapsody. ‘Oh what a mine of undiscovered
treasures, what a new world of power and truth would the
Bible promise to our future meditation, if <em>in some gracious moment
one solitary text of all its inspired contents</em> should but dawn upon
us in the pure untroubled brightness of an <span class='fss'>IDEA</span>, that most glorious
birth of the godlike within us, which even as the light, its material
symbol, reflects itself from a thousand surfaces, and flies homeward to
its parent mind, enriched with a thousand forms, itself above form,
and still remaining in its own simplicity and identity! O for a flash
of that same light, in which the first position of geometric science that
ever loosed itself from the generalizations of a groping and insecure
experience, did for the first time reveal itself to a human intellect in
all its evidence and in all its fruitfulness, Transparence without
Vacuum, and Plenitude without Opacity! O! that a single gleam
of our own inward experience would make comprehensible to us the
rapturous <span class='sc'>Eureka</span>, and the grateful hecatomb of the philosopher of
Samos: or that vision which, from the contemplation of an arithmetical
harmony, rose to the eye of Kepler, presenting the planetary
world, and all their orbits in the divine order of their ranks and
distances; or which, in the falling of an apple, revealed to the
ethereal intuition of our own Newton the constructive principle
of the material universe. The promises which I have ventured
to hold forth concerning the hidden treasures of the Law and
the Prophets will neither be condemned as paradox, or as exaggeration,
by the mind that has learnt to understand the possibility that
the reduction of the sands of the sea to number should be found
a less stupendous problem by Archimedes than the simple conception
of the Parmenidean <span class='sc'>One</span>. What, however, is achievable by
the human understanding without this light may be comprised in
the epithet <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κενόσπουδοι</span> and <em>a melancholy comment on that phrase
would the history of the human Cabinets and Legislatures for the
last thirty years furnish</em>! The excellent Barrow, the last of the
disciples of Plato and Archimedes among our modern mathematicians,
shall give the description and state the value; and, in his words, I
shall conclude:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘<em>Aliud agere, to be impertinently busy, doing that which conduceth to
no good purpose, is, in some respect, worse than to do nothing. Of such
industry we may understand that of the Preacher, “The labour of the
foolish wearieth every one of them.”</em>’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>A better conclusion could not be found for this Lay-Sermon:
for greater nonsense the author could not write, even though he
were inspired expressly for the purpose.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sir,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Your last Sunday’s ‘Literary Notice’ has given me some
uneasiness on two points.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was in January, 1798, just 19 years ago, that I got up one
morning before day-light to walk 10 miles in the mud, and went
to hear a poet and a philosopher preach. It was the author of
the ‘Lay-Sermon.’ Never, Sir, the longest day I have to live,
shall I have such another walk as this cold, raw, comfortless one
in the winter of the year 1798. Mr. Examiner, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il y a des
impressions que ni le tems ni les circonstances peuvent effacer. Dusse-je
vivre des siècles entiers, le doux tems de ma jeunesse ne
peut renaître pour moi, ni s’effacer jamais dans ma mémoire.</span></i>
When I got there, Sir, the organ was playing the 100th psalm,
and when it was done, Mr. C. rose and gave out his text, ‘And
he went up into the mountain to pray, <span class='fss'>HIMSELF, ALONE</span>. As he gave
out this text, his voice ‘rose like a steam of rich distill’d perfumes,’
and when he came to the last two words, which he pronounced loud,
deep, and distinct, it seemed to me, Sir, who was then young, as if
the sounds had echoed from the bottom of the human heart, and as
if that prayer might have floated in solemn silence through the
universe. The idea of St. John came into my mind, ‘of one crying
in the wilderness, who had his loins girt about, and whose food was
locusts and wild honey.’ The preacher then launched into his
subject, like an eagle dallying with the wind. <em>That</em> sermon, like
<em>this</em> Sermon, was upon peace and war; upon church and state—not
their alliance, but their separation—on the spirit of the world and
the spirit of Christianity, not as the same, but as opposed to one
another. He talked of those who had ‘inscribed the cross of Christ
on banners dripping with human gore.’ He made a poetical and
pastoral excursion,—and to shew the fatal effects of war, drew
a striking contrast between the simple shepherd boy, driving his team
afield, or sitting under the hawthorn, piping to his flock, as though
he should never be old, and the same poor country-lad, crimped,
kidnapped, brought into town, made drunk at an ale-house, turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>into a wretched drummer-boy, with his hair sticking on end with
powder and pomatum, a long cue at his back, and tricked out in the
loathsome finery of the profession of blood.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Such were the notes our once-lov’d poet sung.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And for myself, Sir, I could not have been more delighted if I had
heard the music of the spheres. Poetry and Philosophy had met
together, Truth and Genius had embraced, under the eye and with
the sanction of Religion. This was even beyond my hopes. I
returned home well satisfied. The sun that was still labouring pale
and wan through the sky, obscured by thick mists, seemed an
emblem of the <em>good cause</em>: and the cold dank drops of dew that
hung half melted on the beard of the thistle, had something genial
and refreshing in them; for there was a spirit of hope and youth in
all nature, that turned everything into good. The face of nature had
not then the brand of <span class='sc'>Jus Divinum</span> on it;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like to that sanguine flower inscrib’d with woe.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Now, Sir, what I have to complain of is this, that from reading
your account of the ‘Lay-Sermon,’ I begin to suspect that my
notions formerly must have been little better than a deception: that
my faith in Mr. Coleridge’s great powers must have been a vision of
my youth, that, like other such visions, must pass away from me;
and that all his genius and eloquence is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox et preterea nihil</span></i>: for otherwise
how is it so lost to all common sense upon paper?</p>

<p class='c010'>Again, Sir, I ask Mr. Coleridge, why, having preached such a
sermon as I have described, he has published such a sermon as you
have described? What right, Sir, has he or any man to make a fool
of me or any man? I am naturally, Sir, a man of a plain, dull, dry
understanding, without flights or fancies, and can just contrive to
plod on, if left to myself: what right, then has Mr. C., who is just
going to ascend in a balloon, to offer me a seat in the parachute, only to
throw me from the height of his career upon the ground, and dash me
to pieces? Or again, what right has he to invite me to a feast of
poets and philosophers, fruits and flowers intermixed,—immortal
fruits and amaranthine flowers,—and then to tell me it is all vapour,
and, like <em>Timon</em>, to throw his empty dishes in my face? No, Sir, I
must and will say it is hard. I hope, between ourselves, there is no
breach of confidence in all this; nor do I well understand how men’s
opinions on moral, political, or religious subjects can be kept a
secret, except by putting them in <cite>The Correspondent</cite>.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c011'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>‘On the 19th May I was informed by the Minister Secretary of
State, Maret, that at seven o’clock of the evening of the following
day I must wait on the Emperor Napoleon. I waited accordingly
on this Minister at the appointed hour, and was presented. The
Emperor sat on a sofa: a few persons whom I did not know stood
at some distance in the apartment. The Emperor began to speak of
the History of Switzerland; told me that I ought to complete it;
that even the more recent times had their interest. He came to the
work of mediation, discovered a very good will, if we do not meddle
with any thing foreign, and remain quietly in the interior. He
proceeded from the Swiss to the old Greek Constitution and History,
to the Theory of Constitutions, to the complete diversity of those of
Asia, (and the causes of this diversity in the climate, polygamy,
&amp;c.) the opposite characters of the Arabian (which the Emperor
highly extolled), and the Tartarian Races (which led to the
irruptions that all civilization had always to dread from that quarter,
and the necessity of a bulwark): the peculiar value of European
culture (never greater freedom, security of property, humanity, and
better laws in general, than since the 15th century); then how
every thing was linked together, and in the inscrutable guidance of an
invisible hand; and how he himself had become great through his
enemies: the great confederation of nations, the idea of which
Henry the Fourth never had: the foundation of all religion and its
necessity; that man could not well bear completely clear truth, and
required to be kept in order; the possibility, however, of a more
happy condition, if the numerous feuds ceased, which were occasioned
by too complicated constitutions (such as the German), and the intolerable
burden suffered by States from excessive armies. A great
deal more besides was said, and indeed we spoke of almost every
country and nation. The Emperor spoke at first in his usual
manner; but the more interesting our conversation became, he
spoke in a lower and lower tone, so that I was obliged to bend
myself quite down to his face; and no man can have understood
what he said (and therefore many things I will not repeat).—I
opposed him occasionally, and he entered into discussion. Quite
impartially and truly, as before God, I must say, that the variety of
his knowledge, the acuteness of his observations, the solidity of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>understanding (not dazzling wit), his grand and comprehensive views,
filled me with astonishment, and his manner of speaking to me, with
love for him. A couple of Marshals, and also the Duke of Benevento,
had entered in the mean time; he did not break off. After
five quarters, or an hour, and an half, he allowed the concert to begin;
and I know not, whether accidentally or from goodness, he desired
pieces, which, one of them especially, had reference to pastoral life
and the Swiss (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rans des Vaches</span></i>). After this, he bowed in a
friendly manner and left the room.—Since the audience with
Frederick (1782), I never had a conversation on such a variety of
subjects, at least with any Prince: if I can judge correctly from recollection,
I must give the Emperor the preference in point of solidity and
comprehension; Frederick was somewhat Voltairian. Besides, there
is in his tone much firmness and vigour, but in his mouth something
as attractive and fascinating as in Frederick. It was one of the
most remarkable days of my life. By his genius and his disinterested
goodness he has also conquered me.’</p>

practised and condemned. We live in a liberal age; and a very
different and much more liberal turn has been given to the whole
matter. Men do indeed change sides, but then it is proper at present
that they should. They go from one extreme to another, they
proceed to the utmost lengths of violence and abuse, both against the

<p class='c013'>They have deserted the cause of liberty in as far as it deserted them;
but no farther. No sinister motives, no disappointed expectations
from a new order of things, no places to be got under the old, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>laureatships, no editorships, no popular odium to contend with, no
court-smiles to inveigle, have had any weight with them, or can be
supposed to have had any. They could not tolerate wrong on any
side, on the side of kings, or of the people. That’s all. They have
changed sides to preserve the integrity of their principles and the
consistency of their characters. They have gone over to the strong
side of the question, merely to shew the conscious purity of their
motives; and they chose the moment of the total failure of all
hopes from the weaker side to desert to the stronger, to put the
matter out of all doubt. They are not only above corruption, but
above suspicion. They have never once been at fault, have neither
sneaked nor shuffled, botched or boggled, in their politics. They
who were loud against the abuses of a principle which they set out
with considering as sacred, the right of a people to chuse their own
form of government, have not turned round to flatter and to screen,
with the closeness of their fulsome embraces, the abuses of a power
which they set out with treating as monstrous, the right of a discarded
family to reign over a nation in perpetuity by the grace of God.
They ‘whose love of liberty was of that dignity that it went hand in
hand even with the vow they made this virgin bride,’ have not
stooped to ‘commit whoredom greedily’ with that old harlot,
Despotism. They ‘who struck the foremost man of all this world
but for supporting robbers,’ have not contaminated their fingers with
base bribes, nor turned receivers of stolen goods for paltry knaves and
licensed freebooters. Nice, scrupulous, firm, inflexible, uncorrupted,
incapable of injustice or disguise; patriots in 1793, and royalists in
1816; at all times extreme and at all times consistent in their
opinions; converts to the cause of kings, only because kings were
converts (unaccountable converts) to the cause of the people: they
have not become, nor are they in danger of becoming, thorough-paced
time-servers, regular-bred courtiers, trammelled tools of despotism,
hired pimps and panders of power. Nothing of the sort. They
have not been made (not they) the overweening dupes of their own
conceit and cunning. These political innocents have not, like the
two poor devils in the <cite>Recruiting Officer</cite>, been laid hold of, entrapped,
kidnapped, by that fell serjeant, Necessity, and then, in the height of
their admiration of ‘the wonderful works of nature’ and the King’s
picture, been enlisted for life in his Majesty’s service, by some
Court crimp, some Treasury scout in the shape of a well-bred
baronet or booby Lord. Our maiden poets, patriots, and philanthropists,
have not, it is to be hoped, like <em>Miss Lucy Lockitt</em>, been
bilked of their virtue, ‘bamboozled and bit.’ They have got into a
house of ill fame in the neighbourhood of Pall-Mall, like <em>Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Clarissa Harlowe</em>, but they will defend their honour to the last gasp
with their pens against that old bawd, Legitimacy, as she did hers
with a pen-knife against the old Lady in Duke’s place; or if the
opiates and provocatives unfairly administered, and almost unavoidable
when people get into such company and such situations, should
for an instant rob them of what they hold most dear, their immaculate
purity, they will, like Richardson’s heroine, die a lingering death of
grief and shame for the trick that has been played upon their
unsuspecting credulity!—See, here comes one of them to answer for
himself. It is the same person who in the year 1800 was for making
an example of the whole House of Commons (in spite of the humble
petition and remonstrance of the writer of this article in favour of a
small minority), for being the echoes of the King’s speeches for
carrying on the war against the French Revolution. What is that
<em>thing</em> he has in his hand? It is not, nor it cannot be, a sonnet to the
King, celebrating his ‘royal fortitude,’ in having brought that war to
a successful close fourteen years after!</p>

teaching a parrot to call jade and rogue to all legitimate princes and
princesses that deserve it, as he used himself to rail at all the
illegitimate ones, whether they deserved it or not; repeating over

Allies and their proceedings; cursing them in Spain, cursing them
in Italy, cursing them in Genoa, cursing them in Saxony, cursing
them in Norway, cursing them in Finland, cursing them in Poland,
cursing them in France, cursing them every where as they deserve,

liberty under the beloved Ferdinand; going into a shivering fit at
the roasting of Protestants under Louis the Desired; biting his lips

pillagings, frauds, treacheries, breaches of written treaties and of
verbal promises; usurpations, pretensions, and overt acts of legitimacy,
since it was restored to itself, to one and the self-same tune that he
used to lift up his voice, ‘his most sweet voice,’ against Bonaparte’s
wars and conquests, till the Stock Exchange was stunned with the

<p class='c010'><em>Once a Jacobin and always a Jacobin</em>, is a maxim, which, notwithstanding

to be true, even of him to this day. <em>Once an Apostate and always an

is true, is that the first is so. A person who is what is called a
Jacobin (and we apply this term in its vulgarest sense to the persons
here meant) that is, who has shaken off certain well known prejudices
with respect to kings or priests, or nobles, cannot so easily resume
them again, whenever his pleasure or his convenience may prompt
him to attempt it. And it is because he cannot resume them again
in good earnest, that he endeavours to make up for his want of
sincerity by violence, either by canting till he makes your soul sicken,
like the author of <cite>The Friend</cite>, or by raving like a Bedlamite, as does
the Editor of <cite>The Times</cite>. Why does he abuse Bonaparte and call
him an upstart? Because he is himself, if he is any thing at all, an
upstart; and because Bonaparte having got the start of him one way,
he turned back to gain the race another, by trying for a court-livery,
and to recommend himself to the house of Brunswick, by proclaiming
the principles of the house of Stuart. Why does he make such a
route about Kings and Queens, and Dukes and Duchesses, and old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>women of all ages and both sexes? Because he cares no more for
them in his heart than we do. How should he? ‘What’s Hecuba

<p class='c013'>None in the world, any more than the poor player in <cite>Hamlet</cite>, who
tried to ‘work his soul to his conceit, tears in his eyes, distraction in

and makes a noise to hide his want of consistency, as cowards turn
bullies to hide their want of courage. He is virulent and vulgar in
proportion as he is insincere; and yet it is the only way in which
he can seem himself not to be a hypocrite. He has no blind
prejudices to repose on; no unshaken principles to refer to; no
hearty attachment to altars or to thrones. You see the Jacobinical
leaven working in every line that he writes, and making strange
havoc with his present professions. He would cashier Louis and
Ferdinand, Alexander and Frederick, to-morrow, and hurl them
headlong from their thrones with a stroke of his pen, for not complying
with any one of his favourite dogmas. He has no regard
for any thing but his own will; no feeling of any thing but of hatred
to the cause he has deserted, and of the necessity of keeping from
his mind, by every demonstration of outward scorn and horror, whatever
might recal his old, unprofitable, exploded errors. His hatred
and dread of the principles of others, proceeds from his greater
hatred and dread of his own. The spectre of his former opinions
glares perpetually near him, and provokes his frantic zeal. For close
behind him stalks the ghost of the French Revolution, <em>that unfortunate

with self-conviction, and make his pen drop from his hands. It is
this morbid conflict with his own feelings that many persons do not
know what to make of, and which gives such a tragic, and at the
same time, ludicrous air to his writings. He is obliged to wink and
shut his apprehension up, so that he is blind, stupidly blind to all
that makes against him, and all that makes for him. His understanding
seems to labour under a quinsy; and instead of the little
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnet rouge</span></i> of 1793, wears a huge pair of Bourbon blinkers for 1816.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Hence the endless inconsistencies in which he involves himself; and
as it is his self-will that makes him insensible to all objections, it is
the same headstrong obstinacy which makes him regardless of contradictions,
and proof against conviction.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a word, to conclude this part of the subject, the writer of <cite>The
Times</cite> is governed entirely by his will; and this faculty is strong,
and bears sway in him, as all other principles are weak. He asserts
a fact the louder, as he suspects it to be without proof: and defends
a measure the more lustily, as he feels it to be mischievous. He
listens only to his passions and his prejudices, not to truth or reason.
Prove to him that any thing is the most idle fiction that ever was
invented, and he will swear to it: prove to him that it is fraught
with destruction to the liberties of mankind in all places and in all
time to come, and he is your own for ever. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed hæc hactenus.</span></i>

<p class='c013'>The meaning of which passage is, that it is easier to sail with the
stream, than to strive against it. Our classical reformers should have
known this passage in Virgil. They should have known themselves
too; but they did not. ‘Let no man go about to cozen honesty,’ or
to be a knave by halves. The man, as well as the woman, who
deliberates between his principle and the price of its sacrifice, is lost.
The same rule holds with respect to literary as to any other kind of
prostitution. It is the first false step that always costs the most; and
which is, for that reason, always fatal. It requires an effort of
resolution, or at least obstinate prejudice, for a man to maintain his
opinions at the expense of his interest. But it requires a much
greater effort of resolution for a man to give up his interest to recover
his independence; because, with the consistency of his character, he
has lost the habitual energy of his mind, and the indirect aid of prejudice
and obstinacy, which are sometimes as useful to virtue as they
are to vice. A man, in adhering to his principles in contradiction to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the decisions of the world, has many disadvantages. He has nothing
to support him but the supposed sense of right; and any defect in the
justice of his cause, or the force of his conviction, must prey on his
mind, in proportion to the delicacy and sensitiveness of its texture:
he is left alone in his opinions; and, like <em>Sam Sharpset</em>, in Mr.
Morton’s new comedy (when he gets into solitary confinement in the
spunging-house,) grows nervous, melancholy, fantastical, and would
be glad of <em>somebody</em> or <em>anybody</em> to sympathize with him; but when he
has once gone over to the strong side of the question (perhaps from
these very scruples of conscience, suggested by weakness and melancholy,
as ‘the Devil is very potent with such spirits, and abuses them
to damn them’) our wavering sceptic no longer finds the same scruples
troublesome; the air of a court promotes their digestion wonderfully;
the load on his conscience falls off at the foot of the throne. The
poet-laureate, standing with his laurel-wreath amidst ‘Britain’s warriors,
her statesmen, and her fair,’ thinks no more or says no more about
the patriots of Spain pining in dungeons or consigned to the torture,
though it was his zeal, his virtuous, patriotic, romantic, disinterested
zeal for them, which brought <em>them</em> there, and him to court. His
Prince’s smile soothes the involuntary pang of sympathy rising in his
breast; and Mr. Croker’s whispers drown their agonizing shrieks.
When we are at Rome, we must do as the people at Rome do. A
man in a crowd must go along with the crowd, and cannot stop to
pick his way; nor need he be so particular about it. He has friends
to back him: appearances are for him; the world is on his side; his
interest becomes surety for his honour, his vanity makes him blind to
objections, or overrules them, and he is not so much ashamed of being
in the wrong in such good company. It requires some fortitude to
oppose one’s opinion, however right, to that of all the world besides;
none at all to agree with it, however wrong. Nothing but the
strongest and clearest conviction can support a man in a losing
minority: any excuse or quibble is sufficient to salve his conscience,
when he has made sure of the main chance, and his understanding
has become the stalking-horse of his ambition. It is this single
circumstance of not being answerable for one’s opinions one’s-self,
but being able to put them off to other men’s shoulders in all crowds
and collections of men, that is the reason of the violence of mobs, the
venality of courts, and the corruption of all corporate bodies. It is
also the reason of the degeneracy of modern apostates and reformed
Jacobins, who find the applause of their king and country doubly
cheering after being so long without it, and who go all lengths in
adulation and servility, to make up for their former awkward
singularity.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Many of the persons we have known, who have deserted the cause
of the people to take a high tone against those who did not chuse to
desert it, have been lawyers or poets. The last took their leave of it
by a poetic license; the first slunk out of it by some loop-hole of the
law. We shall say a word of each.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Our’s is an honest employment,’ says <em>Peachum</em>; ‘and so is a
lawyer’s.’ It is a lawyer’s business to confound truth and falsehood
in the minds of his hearers; and the natural consequence is, that he
confounds them in his own. He takes his opinion of right and
wrong from his brief: his soul is in his fee. His understanding is
<em>upon the town</em>, and at the service of any cause that is paid for before-hand.
He is not a hired suborner of <em>facts</em>, but of <em>reasons</em>; and
though he would not violate the sacred obligation of an oath, as Lord
Ellenborough calls it, by swearing that black is white, he holds himself
at all times in readiness and bound in duty, to prove it so. He
will not swear to an untruth to get himself hanged, but he will assert
it roundly by the hour together to hang other persons, however
innocent,—if he finds it in his retainer. We do not wish to say any
thing illiberal of any profession or set of men in the abstract. But
we think it possible, that they who are employed to argue away men’s
lives at a venture in a court of justice, may be tempted to write them
away deliberately in a newspaper. They who find it consistent with
their honour to do this under the sanction of the court, may find it to
their interest to do the same thing at the suggestion of a court. A
lawyer is a sophist by profession; that is, a person who barters his
opinion, and speaks what he knows to be false in defence of wrong,
and to the prejudice of right. Not only the confirmed habit of looking
at any side of a question with a view to make the worse appear
the better reason, from a motive always foreign to the question itself,
must make truth and falsehood sit loose upon him, and lead him to
‘look on both indifferently,’ as his convenience prompts; but the
quibbles and quillets of the law give a handle to all that is petty and
perverse in his understanding, and enable him to tamper with his
principles with impunity. Thus the intricacy and verbal distinctions
of the profession promote the practical duplicity of its professors; and
folly and knavery become joint securities for one another. The bent
of a lawyer’s mind is to pervert his talents, if he has any, and to keep
down his feelings, if they are at all in his way. He lives by forging
and uttering counterfeit pretexts; he says not what he believes to be
true, but any thing that by any trick or sleight he can make others
believe; and the more petty, artificial, and far-fetched the contrivance,
the more low, contemptible, and desperate the shift, the more is he
admired and cried up in his profession. A perfect lawyer is one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>whose understanding always keeps pace with the inability of words to
keep pace with ideas: who by natural conformation of mind cannot
get beyond the letter to the spirit of any thing; who, by a happy
infirmity of soul, is sure never to lose the form in grasping at the
substance. Such a one is sure to arrive at the head of his profession!
Look at the lawyers in the House of Commons (of course at the
head of their profession)—look at Garrow. We have heard him
stringing contradictions there with the fluency of water, every third
sentence giving the lie to the two former; gabbling folly as if it were
the last opportunity he might ever have, and as regularly put down as
he rose up—not for false statements, not for false reasoning, not for
common-place absurdities or vulgar prejudices, (there is enough of
these to be found there without going to the bar), but for such things
as nobody but a lawyer could utter, and as nobody (not even a lawyer)
could believe. The only thing that ever gave us a good opinion of
the House of Commons was to see the contempt with which they
treat lawyers there. The reason is, that no one there but a lawyer
fancies himself holding a brief in his hand as a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte-blanche</span></i> for vanity
and impertinence—no one else thinks he has got an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</span></i> right to
express any absurd or nonsensical opinions he pleases, because he is
not supposed to hold the opinions he expresses—no one else thinks
it necessary to confound the distinctions of common-sense to subject
them to those of the law (even Lord Castlereagh would never think
of maintaining it to be lawful to detain a person kidnapped from
France, on the special plea, that the law in that case <em>not provided</em> had
<em>not declared</em> it lawful to detain persons so kidnapped, if not reclaimed
by their own country)—no one else thinks of huddling contradictions
into self-evident truths by legal volubility, or of sharpening nonsense
into sense by legal acuteness, or of covering shallow assumptions
under the solemn disguises of the long robe. The opinions of the
gentlemen of the bar go for nothing in the House of Commons: but
their votes tell; and are always sure—in the end! The want of
principle makes up for the want of talent. What a tool in the hands
of a minister is a whole profession, habitually callous to the distinctions
of right and wrong, but perfectly alive to their own interest, with just
ingenuity enough to be able to trump up some fib or sophistry for or
against any measure, and with just understanding enough to see no
more of the real nature or consequences of any measure than suits
their own or their employer’s convenience! What an acquisition to
‘the tried wisdom of parliament’ in the approaching hard season!</p>

<p class='c010'>But all this, though true, seems to fall short of the subject before us.
The weak side of the professional character is rather an indifference
to truth and justice, than an outrageous and inveterate hatred to them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>They are chargeable, as a general class of men, with levity, servility,
and selfishness; but it seems to be quite out of their character to
commence furious and illiberal fanatics against those who have more
principle than themselves. But not when this character is ingrafted
on that of a true Jacobin renegado. Such a person (and no one else)
would be fit to write the leading article in <cite>The Times</cite>. It is this
union of rare accomplishments (there seems, after all, to be nothing
contradictory in the coalition of the vices) that enables that nondescript
person to blend the violence of the bravo with the subtlety of
a pettifogging attorney—to interlard his furious appeals to the lowest
passions of the middle and upper classes, with nice points of law,
reserved for the opinion of the adepts in the profession—to appeal to
the passions of his city readers when any thing wrong is to be done,
and to their cooler and dispassionate judgments when any thing right
is to be done—that makes him stick (spell-bound) to the letter of the
law when it is in his favour, and set every principle of justice and
humanity at defiance when it interferes with his pragmatical opinion—that
makes him disregard all decency as well as reason out of ‘the
lodged hatred’ he bears to the cause he has deserted, and to all who
have not, like himself, deserted it—that made him urge the foul
death of the brave Marshal Ney, by putting a legal interpretation on
a military convention—that tempted him to make out his sanguinary
list of proscribed rebels and regicides (he was not for making out any
such list in the year 1793, nor long after the event he now deplores
with such well-timed indignation)—that makes him desperately bent
on hanging wretches at home in cobweb chains spun from his own
brains—that makes him stake the liberty of nations or the independence
of states on a nickname or a law-quillet, as his irritable humour
or professional habits prevail—that sets him free from all restraints or
deference to others in forming his own opinions, and which would
induce him to subject all the rest of the world to his unprincipled and
frantic dogmas, by entangling them in the quirks and technicalities of
the law! No one else would heroically consign a whole continent to
the most odious and despicable slavery in the world, on the strength
of a flaw in a proclamation: or call that piece of diplomatic atrocity,
the declaration of the 25th of March, a <em>delicious</em> declaration. Such a
man might sell his country, or enslave his species, and justify it to
his conscience and the world by some law-term! Such men are very
dangerous, unless when they are tied up in the forms of a profession,
where form is opposed to form, where no-meaning baffles want of
sense, and where no great harm is done, because there is not much to
do: but when chicane and want of principle are let loose upon the
world, ‘with famine, sword, and fire at their heels, leashed in like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>hounds,’ when they have their prey marked out for them by the
passions, when they are backed by force—when the pen of the Editor
of <cite>The Times</cite> is seconded by eleven hundred thousand bayonets—then
such men are very mischievous.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘My soul, turn from them: turn we to survey’ where poetry,
joined hand in hand with liberty, renews the golden age in 1793,
during the reign of Robespierre, which was hardly thought a blot in
their escutcheon, by those who said and said truly, for what we
know, that he destroyed the lives of hundreds, to save the lives of
thousands: (Mark; then, as now, ‘Carnage was the daughter of
Humanity.’ It is true, these men have changed sides, but not parted
with their principles, that is, with their presumption and egotism)—let
us turn where Pantisocracy’s equal hills and vales arise in visionary
pomp, where Peace and Truth have kissed each other ‘in Philarmonia’s
undivided dale’; and let us see whether the fictions and the
forms of poetry give any better assurance of political consistency than
the fictions and forms of law.</p>

<p class='c010'>The spirit of poetry is in itself favourable to humanity and liberty:
but, we suspect, not in times like these—not in the present reign.
The spirit of poetry is not the spirit of mortification or of martyrdom.
Poetry dwells in a perpetual Utopia of its own, and is, for that reason,
very ill calculated to make a Paradise upon earth, by encountering the
shocks and disappointments of the world. Poetry, like the law, is a
fiction; only a more agreeable one. It does not create difficulties
where they do not exist; but contrives to get rid of them, whether
they exist or not. It is not entangled in cobwebs of its own making,
but soars above all obstacles. It cannot be ‘constrained by mastery.’
It has the range of the universe; it traverses the empyreum, and
looks down on nature from a higher sphere. When it lights upon
the earth, it loses some of its dignity and its use. Its strength is in
its wings; its element the air. Standing on its feet, jostling with the
crowd, it is liable to be overthrown, trampled on, and defaced; for
its wings are of a dazzling brightness, ‘heaven’s own tinct,’ and the
least soil upon them shews to disadvantage. Sunk, degraded as we
have seen it, we shall not insult over it, but leave it to time to take
out the stains, seeing it is a thing immortal as itself. ‘Being so
majestical, we should do it wrong to offer it but the shew of violence.’
But the best things, in their abuse, often become the worst; and so
it is with poetry when it is diverted from its proper end. Poets live
in an ideal world, where they make every thing out according to their
wishes and fancies. They either find things delightful, or make
them so. They feign the beautiful and grand out of their own minds,
and imagine all things to be, not what they are, but what they ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>to be. They are naturally inventors, creators not of truth but beauty:
and while they speak to us from the sacred shrine of their own
hearts, while they pour out the pure treasures of thought to the
world, they cannot be too much admired and applauded: but when,
forgetting their high calling, and becoming tools and puppets in the
hands of others, they would pass off the gewgaws of corruption and
love-tokens of self-interest, as the gifts of the Muse, they cannot be
too much despised and shunned. We do not like novels founded on
facts, nor do we like poets turned courtiers. Poets, it has been said,
succeed best in fiction: and they should for the most part stick to it.
Invention, not upon an imaginary subject, is a lie: the varnishing
over the vices or deformity of actual objects, is hypocrisy. Players
leave their finery at the stage-door, or they would be hooted: poets
come out into the world with all their bravery on, and yet they would
pass for <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> persons. They lend the colours of fancy to whatever
they see: whatever they touch becomes gold, though it were
lead. With them every Joan is a lady: and kings and queens are
human. Matters of fact they embellish at their will, and reason is
the plaything of their passions, their caprice, or interest. There
is no practice so base of which they will not become the panders:
no sophistry of which their understanding may not be made the
voluntary dupe. Their only object is to please their fancy. Their
souls are effeminate, half man and half woman: they want fortitude,
and are without principle. If things do not turn out according to
their wishes, they will make their wishes turn round to things.
They can easily overlook whatever they do not approve, and make
an idol of any thing they please. The object of poetry is to please:
this art naturally gives pleasure, and excites admiration. Poets,
therefore, cannot do well without sympathy and flattery. It is,
accordingly, very much against the grain that they remain long on
the unpopular side of the question. They do not like to be shut
out when laurels are to be given away at court—or places under
government to be disposed of, in romantic situations in the country.
They are happy to be reconciled on the first opportunity to prince
and people, and to exchange their principles for a pension. They
have not always strength of mind to think for themselves; nor honesty
enough to bear the unjust stigma of the opinions they have taken
upon trust from others. Truth alone does not satisfy their pampered
appetites, without the sauce of praise. To prefer truth to all other
things, it requires that the mind should have been at some pains in
finding it out, and that it should feel a severe delight in the contemplation
of truth, seen by its own clear light, and not as it is
reflected in the admiring eyes of the world. A philosopher may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>perhaps make a shift to be contented with the sober draughts of
reason: a poet must have the applause of the world to intoxicate
him. Milton was however a poet, and an honest man; he was
Cromwell’s secretary.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have here described the spirit of poetry when it comes in
contact with the spirit of the world. Let us see what results from
it when it comes in contact with the spirit of Jacobinism. The
spirit of Jacobinism is essentially at variance with the spirit of poetry:
it has ‘no figures nor no fantasies,’ which the prejudices of superstition
or the world draw in the brains of men: ‘no trivial fond
records’: it levels all distinctions of art and nature: it has no pride,
pomp, or circumstance, belonging to it; it converts the whole
principle of admiration in the poet (which is the essence of poetry)
into admiration of himself. The spirit of Jacobin poetry is rank
egotism. We know an instance. It is of a person who founded
a school of poetry on sheer humanity, on ideot boys and mad mothers,
and on Simon Lee, the old huntsman. The secret of the Jacobin
poetry and the anti-jacobin politics of this writer is the same. His
lyrical poetry was a cant of humanity about the commonest people to
level the great with the small; and his political poetry is a cant of
loyalty to level Bonaparte with kings and hereditary imbecility. As
he would put up the commonest of men against kings and nobles, to
satisfy his levelling notions, so for the same reason, he would set up
the meanest of kings against the greatest of men, reposing once more
on the mediocrity of royalty. This person admires nothing that is
admirable, feels no interest in any thing interesting, no grandeur in
any thing grand, no beauty in any thing beautiful. He tolerates
nothing but what he himself creates; he sympathizes only with what
can enter into no competition with him, with ‘the bare earth and
mountains bare, and grass in the green field.’ He sees nothing but
himself and the universe. He hates all greatness, and all pretensions
to it but his own. His egotism is in this respect a madness; for he
scorns even the admiration of himself, thinking it a presumption in
any one to suppose that he has taste or sense enough to understand
him. He hates all science and all art; he hates chemistry, he hates
conchology; he hates Sir Isaac Newton; he hates logic, he hates
metaphysics, which he says are unintelligible, and yet he would be
thought to understand them; he hates prose, he hates all poetry but
his own; he hates Shakespeare, or what he calls ‘those interlocutions
between Lucius and Caius,’ because he would have all the talk to
himself, and considers the movements of passion in <cite>Lear</cite>, <cite>Othello</cite>,
or <cite>Macbeth</cite>, as impertinent, compared with the Moods of his own
Mind; he thinks every thing good is contained in the ‘Lyrical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Ballads,’ or, if it is not contained there, it is good for nothing; he
hates music, dancing, and painting; he hates Rubens, he hates
Rembrandt, he hates Raphael, he hates Titian, he hates Vandyke;
he hates the antique; he hates the Apollo Belvidere; he hates the
Venus de Medicis. He hates all that others love and admire but
himself. He is glad that Bonaparte is sent to St. Helena, and that
the Louvre is dispersed for the same reason—to get rid of the idea
of any thing greater, or thought greater than himself. The Bourbons,
and their processions of the Holy Ghost, give no disturbance to his
vanity; and he therefore gives them none.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>We some time ago promised our friend, Mr. Robert Owen, an
explanation of some of the causes which impede the natural progress
of liberty and human happiness. We have in part redeemed this
pledge in what we said about <cite>Coriolanus</cite>, and we shall try in this
article to redeem it still more. We grant to our ingenious and
romantic friend, that the progress of knowledge and civilization is
in itself favourable to liberty and equality, and that the general
stream of thought and opinion constantly sets in this way, till power
finds the tide of public feeling becoming too strong for it, ready to
sap its rotten foundations, and ‘bore through its castle-walls’; and
then it contrives to turn the tide of knowledge and sentiment clean
the contrary way, and either bribes human reason to take part against
human nature, or knocks it on the head by a more summary process.
Thus, in the year 1792, Mr. Burke became a pensioner for writing
his book against the French Revolution, and Mr. Thomas Paine
was outlawed for his <cite>Rights of Man</cite>. Since that period, the press
has been the great enemy of freedom, the whole weight of that
immense engine (for the purposes of good or ill) having a fatal
bias given to it by the two main springs of fear and favour.</p>

<p class='c010'>The weak sides of human intellect, by which power effects its
conversion to the worst purposes, when it finds the exercise of free
opinion inconsistent with the existence and uncontrouled exercise of
arbitrary power, are these four, viz. the grossness of the imagination,
which is seduced by outward appearances from the pursuit of real
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>ultimate good; the subtlety of the understanding itself, which
palliates by flimsy sophistry the most flagrant abuses; interest and
advancement in the world; and lastly, the feuds and jealousies of
literary men among one another. There is no class of persons so
little calculated to act in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps</span></i> as literary men. All their views are
recluse and separate (for the mind acts by individual energy, and not
by numbers): their motives, whether good or bad, are personal to
themselves, their vanity exclusive, their love of truth independent;
they exist not by the preservation, but the destruction of their own
species; they are governed not by the spirit of unanimity, but of
contradiction. They will hardly allow any thing to be right or any
thing to be wrong, unless they are the first to find out that it is so;
and are ready to prove the best things in the world the worst, and
the worst the best, from the pure impulse of splenetic overweening
self-opinion, much more if they are likely to be well paid for it—not
that interest is their ruling passion, but still it operates, silent and
unseen, with them as with other men, when it can make a compromise
with their vanity. This part of the character of men of
letters is so well known, that Shakespear makes <em>Brutus</em> protest against
the fitness of <em>Cicero</em> to be included in their enterprize on this very
principle:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh, name him not: let us not break with him;</div>
      <div class='line'>For he will never follow any thing,</div>
      <div class='line'>That other men begin.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The whole of Mr. Burke’s <cite>Reflections on the French Revolution</cite><a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c011'><sup>[28]</sup></a> is
but an elaborate and damning comment on this short text. He
quarrelled with the French Revolution out of spite to Rousseau, the
spark of whose genius had kindled the flame of liberty in a nation.
He therefore endeavoured to extinguish the flame—to put out the
light; and he succeeded, because there were others like himself,
ready to sacrifice every manly and generous principle to the morbid,
sickly, effeminate, little, selfish, irritable, dirty spirit of authorship.
Not only did such persons, according to Mr. Coleridge’s valuable
and competent testimony (see his <cite>Lay Sermon</cite>) make the distinction
between Atheism and Religion a mere stalking-horse for the indulgence
of their idle vanity, but they made the other questions of Liberty and
Slavery, of the Rights of Man, or the Divine Right of Kings to
rule millions of men as their Slaves for ever, they made these vital
and paramount questions (which whoever wilfully and knowingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>compromises, is a traitor to himself and his species), subordinate to
the low, whiffling, contemptible gratification of their literary jealousy.
We shall not go over the painful list of instances; neither can we
forget them. But they all or almost all contrived to sneak over one
by one to the side on which ‘empty praise or solid pudding’ was to
be got; they could not live without the smiles of the great (not
they), nor provide for an increasing establishment without a loss of
character; instead of going into some profitable business and exchanging
their lyres for ledgers, their pens for the plough (the honest
road to riches), they chose rather to prostitute their pens to the
mock-heroic defence of the most barefaced of all mummeries, the
pretended alliance of kings and people! We told them how it
would be, if they succeeded; it has turned out just as we said;
and a pretty figure do these companions of Ulysses (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Compagnons du
Lys</span></i>), these gaping converts to despotism, these well-fed victims of
the charms of the Bourbons, now make, nestling under their laurels
in the stye of Corruption, and sunk in torpid repose (from which
they do not like to be disturbed by calling on their former names or
professions), in lazy sinecures and good warm berths! Such is the
history and mystery of literary patriotism and prostitution for the last
twenty years.—Power is subject to none of these disadvantages. It
is one and indivisible; it is self-centered, self-willed, incorrigible,
inaccessible to temptation or entreaty; interest is on its side, passion
is on its side, prejudice is on its side, the name of religion is on its
side; the qualms of conscience it is not subject to, for it is iron-nerved;
humanity it is proof against, for it sets itself up above
humanity; reason it does not hearken to, except that reason which
panders to its will and flatters its pride. It pursues its steady way,
its undeviating everlasting course, ‘unslacked of motion,’ like that
foul Indian idol, the Jaggernaut, and crushes poor upstart poets,
patriots, and philosophers (the beings of an hour) and the successive
never-ending generations of fools and knaves, beneath its feet; and
mankind bow their willing necks to the yoke, and eagerly consign
their children and their children’s children to be torn in pieces by its
scythe, or trampled to death by the gay, gaudy, painted, bloodstained
wheels of the grim idol of power!</p>

<p class='c010'>Such is the state of the Eastern world, where the inherent baseness
of man’s nature, and his tendency to social order, to tyrannize and to
be tyrannized over, has had full time to develope itself. Our turn
seems next. We are but just setting out, it is true, in this bye-nook
and corner of the world—but just recovering from the effects of the
Revolution of 1688, and the defeated Rebellions of the years 1715
and 1745, but we need hardly despair under the auspices of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Editor of <cite>The Times</cite>, and with the example of the defeat ‘of the
last successful instance of a democratic rebellion,’ by the second
restoration of the Bourbons, before our eyes and close under our
noses. Mr. Owen may think the example of New Lanark more
inviting, but the persons to whom he has dedicated his work turn
their eyes another way!<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Man is a toad-eating animal. The admiration of power in others
is as common to man as the love of it in himself: the one makes him
a tyrant, the other a slave. It is not he alone, who wears the golden
crown, that is proud of it: the wretch who pines in a dungeon, and
in chains, is dazzled with it; and if he could but shake off his own
fetters, would care little about the wretches whom he left behind
him, so that he might have an opportunity, on being set free himself,
of gazing at this glittering gewgaw ‘on some high holiday of once a
year.’ The slave, who has no other hope or consolation, clings to
the apparition of royal magnificence, which insults his misery and his
despair; stares through the hollow eyes of famine at the insolence of
pride and luxury which has occasioned it, and hugs his chains the
closer, because he has nothing else left. The French, under the old
regime, made the glory of their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand Monarque</span></i> a set-off against
rags and hunger, equally satisfied with <em>shows or bread</em>; and the poor
Spaniard, delivered from temporary to permanent oppression, looks
up once more with pious awe, to the time-hallowed towers of the
Holy Inquisition. As the herd of mankind are stripped of every
thing, in body and mind, so are they thankful for what is left; as is
the desolation of their hearts and the wreck of their little all, so is
the pomp and pride which is built upon their ruin, and their fawning
admiration of it.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I’ve heard of hearts unkind, kind deeds</div>
      <div class='line'>With coldness still returning:</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! the gratitude of men</div>
      <div class='line'>Has oftener set me mourning.’<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c011'><sup>[30]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>There is something in the human mind, which requires an object
for it to repose on; and, driven from all other sources of pride or
pleasure, it falls in love with misery, and grows enamoured of
oppression. It gazes after the liberty, the happiness, the comfort,
the knowledge, which have been torn from it by the unfeeling gripe
of wealth and power, as the poor debtor gazes with envy and wonder
at the Lord Mayor’s show. Thus is the world by degrees reduced
to a spital or lazar-house, where the people waste away with want
and disease, and are thankful if they are only suffered to crawl
forgotten to their graves. Just in proportion to the systematic
tyranny exercised over a nation, to its loss of a sense of freedom
and the spirit of resistance, will be its loyalty; the most abject
submission will always be rendered to the most confirmed despotism.
The most wretched slaves are the veriest sycophants. The lacquey,
mounted behind his master’s coach, looks down with contempt upon
the mob, forgetting his own origin and his actual situation, and
comparing them only with that standard of gentility which he has
perpetually in his eye. The hireling of the press (a still meaner
slave) wears his livery, and is proud of it. He measures the greatness
of others by his own meanness; their lofty pretensions indemnify him
for his servility; he magnifies the sacredness of their persons to cover
the laxity of his own principles. He offers up his own humanity,
and that of all men, at the shrine of royalty. He sneaks to court;
and the bland accents of power close his ears to the voice of freedom
ever after; its velvet touch makes his heart marble to a people’s
sufferings. He is the intellectual pimp of power, as others are the
practical ones of the pleasures of the great, and often on the same
disinterested principle. For one tyrant, there are a thousand ready
slaves. Man is naturally a worshipper of idols and a lover of kings.
It is the excess of individual power, that strikes and gains over his
imagination: the general misery and degradation which are the
necessary consequences of it, are spread too wide, they lie too
deep, their weight and import are too great, to appeal to any but the
slow, inert, speculative, imperfect faculty of reason. The cause of
liberty is lost in its own truth and magnitude; while the cause of
despotism flourishes, triumphs, and is irresistible in the gross mixture,
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Belle Alliance</span></i>, of pride and ignorance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Power is the grim idol that the world adore; that arms itself with
destruction, and reigns by terror in the coward heart of man; that
dazzles the senses, haunts the imagination, confounds the understanding,
and tames the will, by the vastness of its pretensions, and
the very hopelessness of resistance to them. Nay more, the more
mischievous and extensive the tyranny—the longer it has lasted, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the longer it is likely to last—the stronger is the hold it takes of the
minds of its victims, the devotion to it increasing with the dread. It
does not satisfy the enormity of the appetite for servility, till it has
slain the mind of a nation, and becomes like the evil principle of the
universe, from which there is no escape. So in some countries, the
most destructive animals are held sacred, despair and terror completely
overpowering reason. The prejudices of superstition (religion
is another name for fear) are always the strongest in favour of those
forms of worship which require the most bloody sacrifices; the
foulest idols are those which are approached with the greatest awe;
for it should seem that those objects are the most sacred to passion
and imagination, which are the most revolting to reason and common
sense. No wonder that the Editor of <cite>The Times</cite> bows his head
before the idol of Divine Right, or of Legitimacy, (as he calls it)
which has had more lives sacrificed to its ridiculous and unintelligible
pretensions, in the last twenty-five years, than were ever sacrificed to
any other idol in all preceding ages. Never was there any thing so
well contrived as this fiction of Legitimacy, to suit the fastidious
delicacy of modern sycophants. It hits their grovelling servility and
petulant egotism exactly between wind and water. The contrivers
or re-modellers of this idol, beat all other idol-mongers, whether
Jews, Gentiles or Christians, hollow. The principle of an idolatry
is the same: it is the want of something to admire, without knowing
what or why: it is the love of an effect without a cause; it is a
voluntary tribute of admiration which does not compromise our vanity:
it is setting something up over all the rest of the world, to which we
feel ourselves to be superior, for it is our own handy-work; so that
the more perverse the homage we pay to it, the more it pampers our
self-will: the meaner the object, the more magnificent and pompous
the attributes we bestow upon it; the greater the lie, the more
enthusiastically it is believed and greedily swallowed:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Of whatsoever race his godhead be,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stock, stone, or other homely pedigree,</div>
      <div class='line'>In his defence his servants are as bold</div>
      <div class='line'>As if he had been made of beaten gold.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In this inverted ratio, the bungling impostors of former times, and
less refined countries, got no further than stocks and stones: their
utmost stretch of refinement in absurdity went no further than to
select the most mischievous animals or the most worthless objects for
the adoration of their besotted votaries: but the framers of the new
law-fiction of legitimacy have started a non-entity. The ancients
sometimes worshipped the sun or stars, or deified heroes and great
men: the moderns have found out the image of the divinity in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span>! They have set up an object for their idolatry, which
they themselves must laugh at, if hypocrisy were not with them the
most serious thing in the world. They offer up thirty millions of
men to it as its victims, and yet they know that it is nothing but a
scare-crow to keep the world in subjection to their renegado whimsies
and preposterous hatred of the liberty and happiness of mankind.
They do not think kings gods, but they make believe that they do
so, to degrade their fellows to the rank of brutes. Legitimacy
answers every object of their meanness and malice—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omne tulit punctum</span></i>.—This
mock-doctrine, this little Hunchback, which our resurrection-men,
the Humane Society of Divine Right, have foisted on the altar
of Liberty, is not only a phantom of the imagination, but a contradiction
in terms; it is a prejudice, but an exploded prejudice; it is
an imposture, that imposes on nobody; it is powerful only in impotence,
safe in absurdity, courted from fear and hatred, a dead
prejudice linked to the living mind; the sink of honour, the grave of
liberty, a palsy in the heart of a nation; it claims the species as its
property, and derives its right neither from God nor man; not from
the authority of the Church, which it treats cavalierly, and yet in
contempt of the will of the people, which it scouts as opposed to its
own: its two chief supporters are, the sword of the Duke of
Wellington and the pen of the Editor of <cite>The Times</cite>! The last of
these props has, we understand, just failed it.</p>

<p class='c010'>We formerly gave the Editor of <cite>The Times</cite> a definition of a true
Jacobin, as one ‘who had seen the evening star set over a poor man’s
cottage, and connected it with the hope of human happiness.’
The city-politician laughed this pastoral definition to scorn, and
nicknamed the person who had very innocently laid it down, ‘the
true Jacobin who writes in the Chronicle,’—a nickname by which
we profited as little as he has by our Illustrations. Since that time
our imagination has grown a little less romantic: so we will give him
another, which he may chew the cud upon at his leisure. A true
Jacobin, then, is one who does not believe in the divine right of
kings, or in any other <em>alias</em> for it, which implies that they reign ‘in
contempt of the will of the people’; and he holds all such kings to
be tyrants, and their subjects slaves. To be a true Jacobin, a man
must be a good hater; but this is the most difficult and the least
amiable of all the virtues: the most trying and the most thankless of
all tasks. The love of liberty consists in the hatred of tyrants.
The true Jacobin hates the enemies of liberty as they hate liberty,
with all his strength and with all his might, and with all his heart
and with all his soul. His memory is as long, and his will as strong
as theirs, though his hands are shorter. He never forgets or forgives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>an injury done to the people, for tyrants never forget or forgive one
done to themselves. There is no love lost between them. He does
not leave them the sole benefit of their old motto, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Odia in longum
jaciens quæ conderet auctaque promeret</span></i>. He makes neither peace nor
truce with them. His hatred of wrong only ceases with the wrong.
The sense of it, and of the barefaced assumption of the right to
inflict it, deprives him of his rest. It stagnates in his blood. It
loads his heart with aspics’ tongues, deadly to venal pens. It settles
in his brain—it puts him beside himself. Who will not feel all this
for a girl, a toy, a turn of the dice, a word, a blow, for any thing
relating to himself; and will not the friend of liberty feel as much
for mankind? The love of truth is a passion in his mind, as the
love of power is a passion in the minds of others. Abstract reason,
unassisted by passion, is no match for power and prejudice, armed
with force and cunning. The love of liberty is the love of others;
the love of power is the love of ourselves. The one is real; the
other often but an empty dream. Hence the defection of modern
apostates. While they are looking about, wavering and distracted,
in pursuit of universal good or universal fame, the eye of power is
upon them, like the eye of Providence, that neither slumbers nor
sleeps, and that watches but for one object, its own good. They
take no notice of it at first, but it is still upon them, and never off
them. It at length catches theirs, and they bow to its sacred light;
and like the poor fluttering bird, quail beneath it, are seized with a
vertigo, and drop senseless into its jaws, that close upon them for
ever, and so we see no more of them, which is well.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And we saw three poets in a dream, walking up and down on the
face of the earth, and holding in their hands a human heart, which,
as they raised their eyes to heaven, they kissed and worshipped; and
a mighty shout arose and shook the air, for the towers of the Bastile
had fallen, and a nation had become, of slaves, freemen; and the
three poets, as they heard the sound, leaped and shouted, and made
merry, and their voice was choked with tears of joy, which they
shed over the human heart, which they kissed and worshipped. And
not long after, we saw the same three poets, the one with a receipt-stamp
in his hand, the other with a laurel on his head, and the third
with a symbol which we could make nothing of, for it was neither
literal nor allegorical, following in the train of the Pope and the
Inquisition and the Bourbons, and worshipping the mark of the
Beast, with the emblem of the human heart thrown beneath their
feet, which they trampled and spit upon!’—This apologue is not
worth finishing, nor are the people to whom it relates worth talking
of. We have done with them.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have here a pretty peep behind ‘the dark blanket’ of Legitimacy.
We thank Mr. Macirone for having introduced us once more to the
old lady of that name in her dressing-room. What a tissue of
patches and of paint! What a quantity of wrinkles and of proud
flesh! What a collection of sickly perfumes and slow poisons, with
her love-powders and the assassin’s knife placed side by side! What
treacheries and lies upon her tongue! What meanness and malice
in her heart! What an old hypocritical hag it is! What a vile
canting, mumbling, mischievous witch! ‘Pah! and smells so.’
The very wind that kisses all it meets, stops the nose at her. We
wonder how any prince should take a fancy to such an old rotten
demirep! Yet this is the heroine of all heroines (Mr. Southey will
tell you in hobbling illegitimate verse), a greater heroine than even
<em>his</em> Joan of Arc—the heroine of Leipsic, of Saragossa, and of
Waterloo! It is indeed the same. Look at her again, look at her
well, look at her closely, and you will find that it is ‘that harlot old,’</p>

<p class='c013'>the mother of abominations, the daughter of lies. Dig up the bones
of a few of her wretched favourites you may, in Carmelite dresses or
any other trumpery; but can you dig up the bones of the men that
she has murdered, from the earliest time? can you collect the blood
of the millions of men that she has sacrificed in the last twenty-five
years alone, and pour it into the Thames, while our merchant-men
ride freighted with gold upon the gory stream, and the Editor of
<cite>The Times</cite> (without being called to account for it) applauds with the
‘sweet thunder’ of his pen the proud balance of our exports and our
imports, blood and gold? or can you collect the sighs and dried-up
tears of wretches that she, Legitimacy, has doomed to pine without
a cause in dungeons, to prove that she is the dread sovereign of the
human heart? or the groans and shrieks of victims stretched on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>rack, or consumed by slow fire, to prove that the minds of men
belong to her? or the cries of hunger and pinching cold, the sweat,
the rags, the diseases, the emaciated wan looks, by which she proves
that the bodies of men are her’s? or can you conjure up the wide
spreading desolation which she breathes from her nostrils, the famine
and pestilence which she scatters before her for her sport and wantonness,
the ruins of cities and of countries which she makes her throne,
and from which, amidst the groans of the dying and the dead, she
utters, laughing, the sacred doctrine of ‘millions made for one!’—One
thing contents us, and sits light upon our hearts, that we have
always seen through her disguises: we have known her from first to
last, though ‘she has changed shapes with Proteus,’ and now gone
by the name of Religion, now of Social Order, now of Morality,
now been personified at Guildhall as Trade and Commerce, or sat in
the Speaker’s chair as the English Constitution (the most impudent
trick of all)—under none of these respectable alias’s and swindling
characters, nor when she towered above the conflagration of Moscow,
<em>dressed in a robe of flame-coloured taffeta</em>, or sat perched as Victory on
the crests of British soldiers, nor when she hovered over the frightened
country as the harpy of Invasion; no, nor at any other time did we
ever take her for any thing but what we knew she was, the patron-saint
of tyrants and of slaves; an adulteress, an impostor, and a
murderess. The world, whom she has juggled, begin to find her
out too: it will hardly ‘stand now with her sorceries and her lies,
and the blood of men, with which she has made herself drunk’;
and we may yet live to see her carted for a bawd.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having thus vented the overflowings of our gall against the old
lady above-mentioned, we shall proceed to a detail of some of her
fraudulent transactions, as they are stated with great clearness and
command of temper, in Mr. Macirone’s ‘Interesting Facts.’ Interesting
indeed! But no more comments for the present. We have
not time to grace our narrative or confirm our doctrine of ‘the uses
of <em>legitimacy</em>,’ by giving Mr. Macirone’s history of the treatment of
his family by the Holy See, which brought his father to this country,
and eventually led to his connexion with Murat. It appears that his
grandfather, the head of a noble and wealthy family at Rome, was
ruined in a large concern, and then robbed of his right by Monsignore
Banchieri, treasurer to the Pope, a ‘gentleman and man of honour’
in those times; and that, though the tribunals awarded him reparation,
the decisions in his favour were constantly defeated by the
interposition of the papal power. The consequence was, that the
elder Macirone, after a fruitless struggle of several years with
legitimate power and injustice, died of grief and chagrin, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>family were dispersed in various directions: his eldest son came to
England and married an English lady, of which union our author
was the issue. This short episode shews what Legitimacy, that is,
<em>a power above the law, and accountable only to heaven for its exercise, its
use or its abuse</em>, always was, and always will be. These tricks were
played long before the French revolution, and with a million other
tricks of the same legitimate, that is, lawless kind, produced it.—We
have here an account of some of the tricks resorted to by the
wielders and abettors of mild paternal sway to restore the old right
to do wrong with impunity, and to put down the principles and
partizans of the revolution, as an example of successful rebellion
against power held in contempt of the people, and exercised in disregard
of law. Mr. Macirone, a native of England, went to Italy
at the age of fifteen, and remained there from 1803 till 1812. Part
of this time he was detained as an English prisoner. He was afterwards
employed as an <em>aid-de-camp</em> to Murat, and gives the following
narrative of his transactions with the Allies:—</p>

<p class='c010'>1. A Treaty of Alliance, offensive and defensive, was signed
between Austria and Naples, on the 11th of Jan. 1814, and the
Austrian Plenipotentiary declared that England was ready to accede
to a similar Treaty with King Joachim.—2. A Convention was
signed by Lord William Bentinck with the Neapolitan Government,
which opened the ports of Italy to the British fleet, and
placed affairs on a footing of perfect peace.—3. Murat, on the
strength of these engagements, opened the campaign in concert with
the Allies, when instantly objections were made to the ratification of
the Treaty with Austria, not by Austria, but by England, on some
pretence of the territorial indemnifications to be granted to Murat at
the expense of the Pope.—4. Murat assented to the proposed
modifications, and Lord W. Bentinck declared, that the English
Government now agreed entirely to the Treaty between Austria and
Naples.—5. This declaration of Lord W. Bentinck was confirmed
by a declaration of Lord Castlereagh, that it was only from motives
of delicacy to the King of Sicily that the English Government
delayed the conclusion of a special and separate Treaty with Naples,
<em>that a Treaty of Indemnities to the King of Sicily and of Peace with
King Joachim might go hand in hand</em>.—6. Murat now joined the
campaign of 1814, and turned the scale against France and Napoleon.—In
this state of things, Mr. Macirone observes,—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘A variety of circumstances had now combined to induce the
King to doubt the sincerity of the Allies. <em>The Emperor of Austria
had delayed for many days the transmission of the ratification of the
Treaty of the 11th January. Ferdinand of Sicily had published an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>order of the day to some Sicilian troops about to land at Leghorn, in
which they were informed that they were going to recover his kingdom of
Naples, which he had never ceded, and never would cede. The English
general, Lord William Bentinck, had landed with these troops, under
instructions to excite a revolution in Italy, and had insisted on the
maintenance of a position (Tuscany) which intercepted the communication
between the Neapolitan army and Naples; propositions at the same time
were made in a foreign camp to Neapolitan generals and other officers, for
the expulsion of the then reigning dynasty from the throne of Naples.</em>
The doubts which these circumstances had excited were removed by
a declaration of General Sir Robert Wilson, at Bologna; <em>that he
considered the letter of Lord Castlereagh, containing the promise of a
formal treaty, as of equal value and force with a treaty already signed.
And that neither the executive authority, nor the parliament, would
hesitate to recognize the validity of such an engagement</em>. Indeed, it was
in his opinion more imperative, if possible, than a regular treaty,
<em>because it connected an appeal to honour with an obligation on good faith</em>.
From that moment the King again made the most zealous efforts in
the common cause.’—p. 20.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alas! Sir Robert, ‘How little knew’st thou of Calista!’ as a
body may say. But you have in part redeemed your errors, and
revenged the trick that was thus put upon your <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">preux chevalier</span></i> notions
of honour!—One would think there was shuffling and paltering and
evasion and cant and cunning enough in the foregoing part of this
transaction. What follows is worse. After the campaigns which
so providentially delivered France and Europe from the hands of
illegitimate into those of legitimate power <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en plein droit</span></i>, and while the
immortal congress was yet assembled at Vienna, ‘Prince Talleyrand,
on the part of King Louis,’ says Mr. Macirone, ‘was indefatigable
in his exertions to induce the Austrian government to withdraw their
alliance from the King of Naples, from whom the allied powers had
so recently received the most efficient support. The Austrian
government being warmly urged to undertake the <em>holy war</em> of
legitimacy against its ally, the King of Naples, at length expressed
its willingness to comply, but alleged the exhausted state of the
finances of the country. <em>This difficulty was, it is said, immediately
removed by the British ministers, who offered to defray all the expense of
the expedition</em>, and moreover to furnish a British fleet, in preference to
a French fleet, as proposed by Talleyrand in his famous note, which
fleet should act in concert with and assist the movements of the
Austrian forces.’</p>

<p class='c010'>One would think that after this open and profligate breach of
faith, the legitimates had made up their minds to keep no terms with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>illegitimacy. But, no: expediency turns round once more, and
British honour, simplicity, and good faith, with it! Murat, in
consequence of the preparations against him, attacked the Austrians
‘at the very moment, as it afterwards turned out, that the apprehensions
of his union with Napoleon, who had just returned to France
from Elba, had determined the British Cabinet to attend to the
invocations of justice in his favour. Lord Castlereagh had written
to the Duke of Wellington, who was at that time the plenipotentiary
of the British court at Vienna, and informed him, that <em>in consequence
of the reappearance of Napoleon at the head of the French nation</em>, the
British ministers thought it adviseable to unite all the force they
could collect, and had consequently come to a determination immediately
to conclude a treaty of alliance with the King of Naples.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Bravo, my Lord Castlereagh! you may one day find, after all,
that honesty is the best policy; and we hope the Editor of <cite>The
Times</cite>, in the next number of <cite>The Correspondent</cite>, will relieve his
praises of the allies and his compliments to the Duke of Levis, by
a criticism to prove that Jonathan Wild and Count Fathom were
‘gentlemen and men of honour!’</p>

<p class='c010'>But the tale of blushing British honour is not ended. At the
time when Murat was at the height of his success against the
Austrians, ‘Colonel Dalrymple arrived at Bologna, King Joachim’s
head-quarters, commissioned by Lord William Bentinck, <em>to request
that the territory of his Britannic majesty’s ally, the King of Sardinia,
might not be violated by the Neapolitan army</em>.’—In consequence of
Murat’s polite attention to this delicate request, he lost his campaign,
his crown, and his life; for no sooner was he defeated in his attempts
to force the passage of the Po, which he might easily have effected,
by infringing upon a small corner of the Piedmontese territory, than
‘he was surprized at receiving a notification from Lord William
Bentinck, <em>that his instructions were to join the Austrians against him</em>.’—We
know the consequences of this exquisite simplicity of proceeding
on both sides. Poor Murat! he well deserved his fate, but not at
the hands from which he received it. Foolish fellow! He did not
know that legitimacy keeps no faith with illegitimacy. At present,
we suppose that point is pretty well settled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Murat was senseless enough to believe that he, who had been
made a king by Bonaparte, would be cordially received in the list
of kings by those who were so <em>by divine right</em>; and he was base
enough to turn against his benefactor, his country, and the human
race; but in himself he appears to have been a gallant, generous, and
heroic-minded man. The account of his escape from the Austrians,
and of his landing in France, is interesting:—</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>‘On the king’s approach to Naples with a small remnant of his
army, six thousand of the national guard, with General Macdonald,
minister of war, at their head, marched forth to meet him. They
greeted his return in the most loyal and affectionate manner, exhorting
him still to hope for success in the love and devotedness of his
subjects, swearing that they were all ready to perish in defence of
their king and country; but in consequence of the part England had
taken against him, he declined making any further efforts, which
would only tend to involve the brave and loyal in his own catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘He entered Naples unknown, in the evening of the 19th May,
accompanied by his nephew, who was colonel of the 9th regiment of
lancers, and four privates. He immediately proceeded to his palace,
where he appeared before the queen, pale and emaciated, in the habit
of a lancer; tenderly embracing her, he said, “All is lost, madam,
but my life; that I have not been able to lose.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c011'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>‘Having taken farewell of his children, he caused his hair, which
he had hitherto worn in long ringlets, to be cut short, and habited in
a plain grey suit, accompanied by his nephew, the colonel, he proceeded
on foot to the sea-shore, opposite to the island of Nisida.
He there embarked in a little boat, and proceeded to the neighbouring
island of Ischia. There he remained three days without being
known, and on the fourth, as he was walking on the sea-shore on
the southern side of the island, in company with the colonel, consulting
about the means of effecting their escape to France, they
discovered a small vessel to the east, in full sail, approaching the
spot where they were standing.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘The king immediately hailed the vessel, and getting into a
fishing-boat which was on the shore, ordered the crew to row towards
it, and, as soon as they were perceived, a boat was sent from the
vessel to meet them. The feelings of all parties may easily be
imagined, when, in one of the persons on board, the king recognized
his attached and faithful servant the Duke of Roccaromana, to whom
the vessel belonged, and who, in company with the Marquis Giuliano,
the king’s aid-de-camp, had escaped from Naples, and was proceeding
in this vessel in search of the king, under the greatest anxiety and
apprehension, lest some accident might have befallen him, although,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>previously to quitting the palace, the king had divided with the duke
and marquis a considerable sum in gold, and acquainted them with
his plan of going to Ischia, accompanied only by his nephew, and of
embarking from thence to France.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘The duke could not succeed in effecting his escape from Naples
until three days after the departure of the king. The enemy’s flag
had been hoisted in Ischia; and it appeared highly improbable, under
all circumstances, that the king could have remained there concealed
for those three days. It was unsafe for the duke to attempt landing
on the island, and yet there appeared no other means of ascertaining
whether the king was there or had proceeded on his voyage. In
this embarrassment, it happened that the duke, who was most
anxiously examining the shore of the island with a glass, perceived
and recognized the king. The rest of their voyage proved most
prosperous and expeditious. They landed at Cannes the 27th or
28th of May.’—p. 30.</p>

<p class='c010'>We shall in our next give the particulars of Mr. Macirone’s
interviews with the Duke of Wellington, relating to the convention
of Paris; and we shall be cautious what we say of his Grace’s
observations and conduct on that occasion; for if we were to say
what we think of that noble person, there might be some offence
in it. But we cannot help having an opinion of him, which all that
we hear of him confirms.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>We proceed to Mr. Macirone’s account of the surrender of Paris.
Let it speak for itself:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Immediately after the battle of Waterloo, Napoleon returned to
Paris, and abdicated the throne in <em>favour of his son, who would
have been accepted and proclaimed by the French people</em>, but for the
opposition of two celebrated individuals.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘On this abdication, a commission of government, as it was called,
was formed, consisting of Fouché, the president, Caulincourt, Carnot,
Quinette, and Grenier.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘On the 26th of June, I believe, the Duke of Wellington, at the
head of his victorious army, reached Compeigne. In the course of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the following night, a deputation of five persons was sent to him
from Paris by the two Chambers, to solicit an armistice for a few
days. The avowed purpose of this mission was to afford time for
the return of another deputation, which had been despatched to the
Allied Sovereigns, to assert the right of the French people to choose
their own government, in conformity to the Declaration of the Allies,
<em>that they warred against the person of Napoleon only, and not against the
French people, or to force upon them any particular government</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘The Chamber of Deputies, the majority of the Commissioners of
Government, and the Army, now in great strength in Paris, were
<em>determined to resist any attempt to force the Bourbons upon them</em>;
while the avowed opinion of Fouché and Caulincourt was, that such
a determination could only lead to the destruction of Paris, and the
loss of thousands of lives. They therefore sought the means of
opening a communication with the Duke of Wellington, in which
they might impart to him their views, and avert the calamity which
they apprehended from the projects of the other parties. In the
expediency of procuring an armistice for a few days, <em>all</em> parties
concurred; and Fouché, who had become acquainted with me in
my interviews with him respecting King Joachim, solicited me to
undertake the task of carrying on a communication between him and
the Duke of Wellington. It was sufficient for me to know that the
service in which I was to be engaged had for its object the prevention
of a sanguinary conflict, which an attempt to take Paris by force
would have occasioned, and I therefore consented to be the bearer of
Fouché’s message to the Duke.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘My feelings as an Englishman entirely influenced my conduct in
this instance. I exulted in the success of our army, and in the
military glory which the English name had acquired; and it appeared
to me, that whatever might tend to prevent the further effusion of
blood, must be highly acceptable to my country; and to be selected
as an instrument, by which so humane and desirable an object might
be accomplished, was highly gratifying to my mind, and I should not
have thought myself at liberty to refuse to engage in it, from any
opinion I might entertain of the private views of the persons by whom
I should be employed. Impressed with these sentiments, I left
Paris at midnight. I proceeded to the Barriere de la Villette, where
I found some difficulty in getting my carriage over the different
entrenchments and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abattis</span></i>, but still more from the French officers,
who evinced the greatest reluctance in permitting me to pass, observing
that I was probably a person sent out to treat with the enemy,
and to betray them; but on my assuring them that the purport of
my mission was entirely analogous to their views and interests, I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>suffered to proceed without a trumpet. Before I had got beyond
the French lines, I was again stopped by a picquet of cuirassiers, who
refused to let me pass without an order from the officer commanding
the inner posts; and while I was asserting my right to proceed, a
cuirassier fortunately happened to hold a light to my face, and very
respectfully accosted me with the salutation of “bon voyage Major”:
his comrades immediately asked him who I was? he answered, “it’s
the Major of the 9th Hussars,” for whom I suppose he had mistaken
me. This was instantly believed; and, greeted by the salutations
and good wishes of the whole troop, I was allowed to continue my
journey.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘The Prussian advanced posts were at less than two miles distant,
and I was consequently very soon stopped by a Prussian lancer, who,
upon my telling him that I was an English officer, proceeding with
dispatches to the Duke of Wellington, immediately accompanied me
to the next post. Here I learnt with great pleasure, that this
advanced guard of cavalry was commanded by Prince William of
Prussia, whose first Aid-de-camp, Baron Rochow, was my particular
friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I soon arrived at the spot where Prince William and his Staff
were sleeping in a field, before a large fire, under some trees. I
inquired for my friend, Baron Rochow. His name was called, and
I immediately had the pleasure of seeing him. After a few urgent
questions, he proposed to introduce me to Prince William, who by
this time had raised himself upon his mattrass. The Prince received
me with the greatest politeness, and directed that I should be
presented with refreshments. On my taking leave, he ordered me
to be furnished with an escort to General Baron Bulow. I arrived
at this General’s quarters at break of day, and was soon after introduced
to him. While I was at breakfast with him, he told me that
he wished me to see Prince Blucher on my way to the Duke of
Wellington; and added, that he would send his Aid-de-camp with
me. He then ordered his servant to call his Aid-de-camp, Baron
Echardstein, to whom I was also particularly known.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘On our arrival at Prince Blucher’s, my companion, Baron
Echardstein informed him that I was going on a mission from the
French Government to the Duke of Wellington; this did not seem
to please the Prince, who immediately retired to rest, and left me to
converse with his Chef-d’etat-Major. This gentleman, whose name
I believe was Gneisenau, was very indignant on being informed of
the desire of the French to treat with the Duke of Wellington; and
he completely lost his temper when he observed the coolness with
which I listened to his indiscreet and authoritative language.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>‘On my quitting this choleric soldier, my friend Echardstein
thought it necessary to apologise to me for the indelicate behaviour of
his countryman. I proceeded on my journey, and soon met numerous
columns of English cavalry, and found the five French Deputies,
waiting for the Duke’s arrival, at a village called Fresnoy. I thought
it expedient to endeavour to see the Duke before the Deputies, and
therefore passed them on the road. I shortly after met the Duke,
and imparted to him the purport of my mission, and delivered to him
also a sealed dispatch from Fouché, upon which he desired me to
accompany him to the village where the Deputies were. He asked
me if I was acquainted with the nature of the mission. I told him
that I knew that one part of it, at least, was to request an armistice
of some days, until news could arrive from other Deputies, who had
been sent to treat with the united Sovereigns.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘On the Duke’s arrival at the village of Fresnoy, he conferred
with the Deputies for five hours. They adduced, in support of their
missions, the solemn declaration of the British Ministers, “that it
was not the intention of the Allies to force the Bourbons, or any other
government, on the French people; that they had made war against
Napoleon only, and not against the nation,” &amp;c. Their mission
failed. They received for answer, that the only thing left for the
Chambers to do was to proclaim Louis 18th.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘The Duke then proceeded to Plessis, the head-quarters for that
day. The Deputies remained behind. I was desired by the Duke
to accompany him to Plessis, where I dined with him, and during
dinner conversed with him on the object I had to propose respecting
an armistice. Before I took my leave of the Duke, I requested that
he would give me some answer to the remonstrances of the Commission
of Government, which stated, “<em>that as the Allies had declared
their hostility to be directed against the person of Napoleon only, it would
be but just to await the result of the mission to the Sovereigns, before his
Grace undertook to replace Louis 18th on the throne</em>.” The Duke, in
the presence of Lord March, Colonels Hervey, Freemantle, Abercromby,
and several other officers, replied,—“I can give no other
answer than that which you know <em>I have just given</em> to the Deputies.
<em>Tell them (the Commission of Government) that they had better immediately
proclaim the King (Louis 18th). I cannot treat till then, nor upon any
other condition. Their King is here at hand: let them send their
submission to him.</em>”</p>

<p class='c010'>We are glad the Duke is not an Englishman?<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c011'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>‘The Duke was at this time in constant communication with King
Louis and Talleyrand, who were together in the rear of the army;
and I saw one of the messengers of Louis 18th at the Duke’s head-quarters.—I
returned to Paris the next morning. Davoust had
taken the chief command of the French army, and had fixed his
head-quarters at the Barriere de la Villette, by which I entered Paris.
On my being introduced to him, he demanded to know the object of
my mission to the enemy, and said, that as he then held the supreme
command, I must communicate to him any dispatches of which I
might be the bearer? I answered him, that I had no written message;
that my mission had been nearly similar to that of the Deputies; that
I had been sent out by the Commission, and therefore thought it my
duty to account with its members only for my proceedings. I could,
however, inform him of the declaration, which, in common with the
Deputies, I had received from the Duke of Wellington. Hereupon
I reported to him the Duke’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</span></i>. He immediately declared
that my intelligence was incredible, and expressed his disbelief of it
in the strongest terms. Then, with the greatest emotion, and with
uplifted hands and eyes, <em>he called heaven to witness the perfidy and
arrogant injustice of the English Ministry, and of the Allies</em>. “<em>The
Duke of Wellington</em>,” said he, “<em>surely could never dare to make a
declaration so directly contrary to the avowed and solemnly protested
intentions of the British Ministry, and of the other Allies</em>. <em>Have not
they sworn that they would not impose a sovereign on the French people?
However, they will find to their cost, that we are unanimous in our
resolution. Napoleon can no longer be the pretext for their hostilities.
We will all perish rather than submit to the hateful yoke that Lord
Castlereagh would impose upon us! —— is a traitor! he was about to
compromise with the enemy—I have taken his command from him—he
shall never again command a corporal’s guard—we are an independent
nation—England should be the last power to tyrannize over us in
our choice of a government.</em>”—He then desired me to proceed to
lay before the Commission at the Thuilleries the result of my
mission, adding, “they know very well that I have now with me
more than 100,000 men, with 500 pieces of cannon, and 25,000
cavalry.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>‘I proceeded to the palace of the Thuilleries, where I was
introduced to the Commission. Carnot immediately asked, what my
errand to the enemy had been? Fouché quickly answered, that he
had sent me. Quinette and Grenier looked as if they were not
satisfied with this answer. Carnot continued to address me, and
asked whether I had seen the Deputies at the Duke of Wellington’s
head-quarters? I answered in the affirmative, and that I could give
him an account of the result of their mission: upon this they became
attentive, and heard my account with dismay and indignation. Carnot
expressed the same sentiments that Davoust had recently done; and
added, rather roughly, that he could by no means give credit to my
account, either as to the Duke of Wellington’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</span></i>, or as to
the force of the enemy in the vicinity of Paris: he further said, with
a sneer, “we shall have, I hope, a very different account on the
return of the Deputies.” Fouché defended me, and reproved him
for so uncivilly questioning my veracity, and assured him that he
might put implicit confidence in me. Carnot and Grenier then took
me to a topographical map, and questioned me as to the movements of
the Duke of Wellington? I answered their interrogatories to the
extent to which I thought myself warranted: and it appeared that I
informed them of nothing with which they were not already acquainted.
Carnot then, in a polite manner, told me I might retire.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘It would appear, that in consequence of having learned from me
the nature of the communication which the Deputies would have to
make to the Chambers, and dreading its discouraging effects on the
members, and on the people at large, their return to Paris had been
prevented. Some private orders seem to have been given to that
effect; for on the same day that I entered Paris by the Barriere de la
Villette, the Deputies approached that part, preceded by Colonel
Latour Maubourg, who was attached to their mission, when the
French out-posts fired, killed the Prussian trumpeter’s horse, and a
ball grazed the epaulette of the Colonel. The Deputies turned back,
and attempted to enter by the Barriere de St. Dennis, but were
refused. They there received fresh instructions to treat, and it
was so managed, that they did not return to Paris till after the
capitulation.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘In the mean time Fouché and his coadjutors, who opposed the
views of the other parties, were in great personal danger. The three
other Members of the Commission more than suspected them of
duplicity and treachery; and in consequence impeached them before
the Chamber of Deputies. The Duke of Wellington being acquainted
with these proceedings, sent a message to the Members of the Commission,
as I was informed, assuring them that if any harm befel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Fouché or Caulincourt, he would infallibly <em>hang up the other three on
his arrival in Paris</em>.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c011'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>‘It was proposed in the Chamber of Deputies, that its Members
should quit Paris with the army, and rally round them all those who
would oppose the enemy and the Bourbons. But this measure
Fouché was particularly anxious to thwart, whilst Davoust feeling
himself confident in the strength of his army, insisted on attacking
Blucher and the Duke of Wellington before other reinforcements
should arrive; but as I understood at the time, Fouché succeeded in
somewhat softening and in giving a new direction to the policy of
Carnot: and it is certain that he managed to gain over Davoust by
urging the force of the enemy, and the dreadful consequences that
would ensue if Paris should be taken by assault. He pleaded the
reliance which might be placed <em>on the faith of the English</em> (for with
the Prussians the French would not have treated on any terms).
He therefore recommended Davoust to evacuate Paris, and not to
listen to the desperate suggestions of the Chambers, observing, that so
long as his army remained entire, he might obtain favourable terms
for all parties.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘The day before the capitulation of Paris (2d July), I repaired
to the British camp with the following memorandum, as my instructions,
from Fouché to the Duke of Wellington:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘“The army opposes, because uneasy—assure it, it will even
become devoted.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘“The Chambers are counter for the same reason. <em>Assure every
body you will have every body.</em></p>

<p class='c010'>‘“The army sent away, the Chambers will agree, on according
them the guarantee, as added to the charter and promised by the
king. In order to be well understood, it is necessary to explain;
therefore not to enter Paris before three days, and in the meantime
every thing may be arranged.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘“The Chambers will be gained, will believe in their independence,
and will agree to every thing. Persuasion, not force, must be used
with the Chambers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>‘On my arrival at the British advanced posts, which, owing to the
obstructions I met with from the French, I was not able to effect till
early in the morning of the 3d July, I was informed that the most
positive orders had been given by the duke, not to allow any messenger
to pass from Paris without his special permission. I was therefore
detained at the English advanced post of guards, commanded by Lord
Saltown. I dined with the officers of the advanced piquet, among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>whom I well remember Captain Fairfield, of the foot guards. These
gentlemen informed me that the Duke of Wellington was at Gonnesse,
with Sir C. Stuart, Pozzo di Borgo, and Talleyrand. I wrote a
letter to the duke, which was forwarded by Lord Saltown. In my
letter, I entered into a detail of the line of conduct recommended by
Fouché, and contained in the foregoing memorandum. On the
receipt of my dispatch, the duke immediately proceeded to St. Cloud,
General Blucher’s head-quarters; there the capitulation of Paris was
signed. The duke returned to Gonnesse and dispatched Lord
March to bring me to him: I arrived very early on the morning of
the 4th, and found Sir C. Stuart, Talleyrand, and Pozzo di Borgo;
they assembled in council, and my presence was required by the duke.
Talleyrand observed to me, that <em>this was already settled</em>, and, turning
to the Duke of Wellington, requested him to read to me <em>the capitulation
that they had just concluded</em>. On my urging the adoption of the
line of conduct which Fouché recommended towards the Chambers,
the Duke of Wellington proceeded to give me his sentiments in
writing, which were as follow:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je pense, que les Allies ayant déclaré le Gouvernment de Napoleon
une Usurpation et nonlégitime, toute autorité qui émane de lui, doit être
regardée comme nulle et d’aucun pouvoir.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c011'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Ainsi, ce qui reste à faire aux
Chambres et à la commission, est, de donner de suite leur démission et de
déclarer qu’ils n’ont pris sur eux les responsibilités de gouvernement, que
pour assurer la tranquilité publique, et l’intégrité du royaume de S. M.
Louis XVIII.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Talleyrand, Sir Charles Stuart, and Pozzo di Borgo, each took a
copy of this document, and each, by way of memorandum, put their
names and mine to the paper, by way of recording, as I suppose, the
parties present at the discussion.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I forthwith mounted my horse and returned to Paris; Lord
March was appointed by the duke to accompany me. On our arrival
at the Barriere de la Villette, we found the French soldiery perfectly
frantic, and vociferating “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur!</span></i>” “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A bas les Anglais!</span></i>”
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A bas les Bourbons!</span></i>” They were on the point of firing at the
Belgian trumpeter who preceded us: it was with the greatest difficulty
that some French hussars, under whose escort we had approached the
barriers, could prevent the soldiers from firing at Lord March as he
was riding off. They were also obliged to exert themselves strenuously
in my defence, as many of the infantry pointed their muskets at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>me, vociferating “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur!</span></i>” “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive Napoleon!</span></i>” “We
are betrayed!” “We have been sold!” “We will fight to the
last drop of our blood!” “Down with the Bourbons!” “Let
us kill this traitor!” “He has assisted in selling us!” “We
have seen him pass before!” The hussars took me between them,
some of the infantry also assisted in parrying off the blows aimed at
me, and turning aside the muzzles of the muskets. Thus, after great
peril, I was fortunate enough to gain the quarters of a general officer,
with only a sabre cut on my left leg. The general dispersed the
men, and gave me a strong escort to conduct me to the Thuilleries.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘In consequence of my communicating the documents and assurances
I had received from Talleyrand and the Duke of Wellington, the
commission of government abdicated its powers that evening; but the
Chambers still refused to comply; they continued their sittings,
which they declared should be permanent, till the morning of the 6th,
when the doors of the Chamber were closed, and guarded by a party
of the national guards.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘On this, above one hundred and fifty of the deputies proceeded
to the house of M. Lanjuinais, their president, and there framed a
solemn protest against the arbitrary and illegal violence which had
been used towards them, <em>in violation of the most solemn declarations</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I have now no doubt that some extraordinary scheme had been contrived
to seduce Napoleon into the measure of abdicating the throne
in favour of his son. His resources were at that moment immense.
The regular army in Paris alone, amounted to more than 80,000
men, every individual of which was animated with the most enthusiastic
ardour. The national guard, above 30,000 strong, displayed the
firmest resolution to obey the directions of the constituted authorities;
numerous volunteers of all classes had taken up arms in the defence
of their country. In the departments, the spirit of opposition to the
invaders was still greater, particularly in the north, west, and east: in
fine, Napoleon, who could not possibly be ignorant of the state of his
resources, would never, I am convinced, have sheathed his sword,
and abdicated the crown <em>even in favour of his son</em>, had he not been
most confidently assured of the validity of the measure, and its being
approved and supported by the French senate and people, and by at
least <em>some part</em> of the coalition.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What were the precise representations by which Napoleon was
influenced to take this step, is perhaps known only to its contrivers,
and their victim. Some future historian may probably unfold this
mystery. As far as regards the share I had in the negociations
between the provisional government, the allied armies, and Talleyrand,
as minister of Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span>, I feel it due to myself to declare, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span><em>I had no suspicion of any deception or intended breach of engagements.</em> I
was requested to open a communication between Fouché and the
Duke of Wellington, for the avowed purpose of negociating an
armistice, as a preliminary measure to the capitulation of Paris;
and it was obvious that such a negociation might save the lives of
thousands of my countrymen.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Play is over, now let us go to Supper.</span></p>

<p class='c010'>John Bull, John Bull, John Bull, read the above account twice
over, think well of it, and then say why you should not wear the
yoke, which you have put round the neck of others, round your
own. Ah! John, thou art not a metaphysician: thou dost lack a
concatenation of ideas!—We are not proud of the share which as
Englishmen we had in the proceedings recorded by Mr. Macirone:
but we have one consolation for our national pride, Fouché and
Talleyrand are Frenchmen. These two pettifogging miscreants
seem to have made themselves perfect in the advice of the fool in
<cite>Lear</cite>: ‘Let go thy hold, when a great wheel runs down hill, lest it
should break thy neck with following it: but the great one that goes
upwards, let it draw thee after. When a wise man gives thee better
counsel, give me mine again: I would have none but knaves follow
it.’ The great wheel, however, in this instance, kicked off the two
knaves, that followed the fool’s advice. One of these famous persons
now writes letters of apology to the Duke of Wellington, and the
other to Lord Castlereagh. They are not so well off as Murat and
Berthier, one of whom was legitimately shot through the head, and
the other legitimately thrown out of a window, if we are to believe
Mr. Macirone, that he might die in <em>the good cause</em>—‘a master-leaver,
and a fugitive.’</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>According to this theory of personal continuity, the author of the
Dramatic Poem, to be here noticed, is the father of Parliamentary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Reform in the Quarterly Review. It is said to be a wise child
that knows its own father: and we understand Mr. Southey (who is
in this case reputed father and son) utterly disclaims the hypostatical
union between the Quarterly Reviewer and the Dramatic Poet, and
means to enter an injunction against the latter, as a bastard and impostor.
Appearances are somewhat staggering against the legitimacy
of the descent, yet we perceive a strong family-likeness remaining,
in spite of the lapse of years and alteration of circumstances. We
should not, indeed, be able to predict that the author of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>
would ever write the article on Parliamentary Reform; nor should
we, either at first or second sight, perceive that the Quarterly
Reviewer had ever written a poem like that which is before us:
but if we were told that both performances were literally and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i>
by the same person, we should have little hesitation in saying to
Mr. Southey, ‘Thou art the man.’ We know no other person in
whom ‘fierce extremes’ meet with such mutual self-complacency:
whose opinions change so much without any change in the author’s
mind; who lives so entirely in the ‘present ignorant thought,’
without the smallest ‘discourse of reason looking before or after.’
Mr. Southey is a man incapable of reasoning connectedly on any
subject. He has not strength of mind to see the whole of any
question; he has not modesty to suspend his judgment till he has
examined the grounds of it. He can comprehend but one idea at
a time, and that is always an extreme one; because he will neither
listen to, nor tolerate any thing that can disturb or moderate the
petulance of his self-opinion. <em>The woman that deliberates is lost.</em> So
it is with the effeminate soul of Mr. Southey. Any concession is
fatal to his consistency; and he can only keep out of one absurdity
by the tenaciousness with which he stickles for another. He calls to
the aid of his disjointed opinions a proportionate quantity of spleen;
and regularly makes up for the weakness of his own <em>reasons</em>, by
charging others with <em>bad motives</em>. The terms <em>knave and fool</em>, <em>wise
and good</em>, have undergone a total change in the last twenty years: the
former he applies to all those who agreed with him formerly—the
latter to all those who agree with him now. His public spirit was
then a prude and a scold; and ‘his poor virtue,’ turned into a
literary prostitute, is grown more abusive than ever. Wat Tyler
and the Quarterly Review are an illustration of these remarks. The
author of Wat Tyler was an Ultra-jacobin; the author of Parliamentary
Reform is an Ultra-royalist; the one was a frantic demagogue;
the other is a servile court-tool: the one maintained second-hand
paradoxes; the other repeats second-hand common-places: the one
vented those opinions which gratified the vanity of youth; the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>adopts those prejudices which are most conducive to the convenience
of age: the one saw nothing but the abuses of power; the other sees
nothing but the horrors of resistance to those abuses: the one did
not stop short of general anarchy; the other goes the whole length
of despotism; the one vilified kings, priests, and nobles; the other
vilifies the people: the one was for universal suffrage and perfect
equality; the other is for seat-selling, and the increasing influence of
the Crown: the one admired the preaching of John Ball; the other
recommends the Suspension of the Habeas Corpus, and the putting
down of the <cite>Examiner</cite> by the sword, the dagger, or the thumb-screw;
for the pen, Mr. Southey tells us, is not sufficient. We wonder that
in all this contempt which our prose-poet has felt at different times
for different persons and things, he has never felt any dissatisfaction
with himself, or distrust of his own infallibility. Our differing from
others sometimes staggers our confidence in our own conclusions: if
we had been chargeable with as many contradictions as Mr. Southey,
we suppose we should have had the same senseless self-sufficiency.
A changeling is your only oracle. Those who have undergone a
total change of sentiment on important questions, ought certainly to
learn modesty in themselves, and moderation towards others; on the
contrary, they are generally the most violent in their own opinions,
and the most intolerant towards others; the reason of which we have
shewn elsewhere, to the satisfaction of the proprietor of the <cite>Old Times</cite>.
Before we have done, we shall, perhaps, do the same thing to the
satisfaction of the publisher of the Quarterly Review; for the Mr.
Murrays and the Mr. Walters, the patrons of the band of gentlemen-pensioners
and servile authors, have ‘a sort of squint’ in their
understanding, and look less to the dirty sacrifices of their drudges,
or the dirtier they are ready to make, than to their standing well
with that great keeper, the public, for purity and innocence. The
band of gentlemen-pensioners and servile authors do not know what
to make of this, and hardly believe it: we shall in time convince
them.</p>

<h3 id='COURIER' class='c003'>THE COURIER AND ‘THE WAT TYLER.’</h3>

<p class='c014'>Doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth, that he
cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences, and these paper bullets of
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?—<cite>Much Ado about Nothing.</cite></p>

<div class='c021'><em>March 30, 1817.</em></div>

<p class='c010'>Instead of applying for an injunction against <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>, Mr. Southey
would do well to apply for an injunction against Mr. Coleridge, who
has undertaken his defence in <cite>The Courier</cite>. If he can escape from
the ominous patronage of that gentleman’s pen, he has nothing to fear
from his own. ‘The <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>,’ as Mr. Coleridge has personified
it, can do the author no great harm: it only proves that he was once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>a wild enthusiast: of the two characters, for which Mr. Southey is a
candidate with the public, this is the most creditable for him to appear
in. At present his reputation ‘somewhat smacks.’ A strong dose
of the Jacobin spirit of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite> may be of use to get the sickly
taste of the Poet-laureate and the Quarterly Reviewer out of our
mouths.</p>

<p class='c010'>The best thing for Mr. Southey (if we might be allowed to
advise) would be for his friends to say nothing about him, and for
him to say nothing about other people. We have nothing to do
with Mr. Southey ‘the man,’ or even with Mr. Southey the apostate;
but we have something to do with Mr. Southey the spy and informer.
Is it not a little strange, that while this gentleman is getting an injunction
against himself as the author of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>, he is recommending
gagging bills against us, and the making up by force for his
deficiency in argument! There is a want of keeping in this; but
Mr. Southey and his friends delight in practical and speculative
contradictions. What are we to think of a man who is ‘now a
flagitious incendiary,’ (to use the epithets which Mr. Southey applies
to the Editor of the <cite>Examiner</cite>) ‘a palliater of murder, insurrection,
and treason,’ and anon a pensioned scribbler of court poetry and court
politics? If the writer of the article on Parliamentary Reform thinks
the Editor of this Paper ‘a flagitious incendiary,’ ‘a palliater of
murder, insurrection, and treason,’ what does the Quarterly Reviewer
think of the author of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>? What, on the other hand, does the
author of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite> think of the Quarterly Reviewer? What does
Mr. Southey, who certainly makes a very aukward figure between the
two, think of himself? Mr. Coleridge indeed steps in to the
assistance of his friend in this dilemma, and says (unsaying all that he
says besides) that the ultra-jacobinical opinions advanced in <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>
were ‘more an honour to the writer’s heart than an imputation on his
understanding?’ Be it so. The Editor of this Paper will, we dare
say, agree to this statement from disinterested motives, (for he is not
answerable for any ultra-jacobinical opinions) as we suppose Mr.
Southey will accede to it from pure self-love. He hardly thinks that
he was ‘a knave and fool’ formerly, as he calls all those who
formerly agreed or now differ with him: he only thinks with Mr.
Coleridge and <cite>The Courier</cite>, that he was not quite so ‘wise and
virtuous’ then, as he is at present! Why then not extend the same
charitable interpretation to those who have held a middle course
between his opposite extravagances? We are sure, that to be
thought <em>a little less wise and virtuous</em> than that celebrated person
thinks himself, would content the ambition of any moderate man.
Will he allow of nothing short of the utmost intolerance of jacobinism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>or anti-jacobinism? Or will he tolerate this intolerance in
nobody but himself? This seems to be his feeling: and it also
seems to be Mr. Coleridge’s opinion, whose maudlin methodistical
casuistry leads him to clothe Mr. Southey’s political sins with
apostacy as with a garment, and to plead one excess of folly and
indecency as a competent set-off against another. To be a renegado,
is, with him, to be virtuous. The greater the sinner the greater the
saint, says <cite>The Courier</cite>. Mr. Southey’s Muse is confessedly not a
vestal; but then she is what is much better, a Magdalen. Now a
Magdalen is a person who has returned to her first habits and notions
of virtue: but Mr. Southey’s laurelled Muse is at present in high
court-keeping, and tosses up her nose at the very mention of reform.
Nor do we think Mr. Southey has a fairer claim to the degree of
respectability good-naturedly assigned him by his friends, that of a
pickpocket or highwayman turned thief-taker or king’s evidence; for
he in fact belies his own character to blacken every honest principle,
and takes the government reward for betraying better men than
himself. There are, as <cite>The Courier</cite> observes, youthful indiscretions;
but there are also riper and more deliberate errors. A woman is
more liable to prostitute her person at nineteen—a man is more likely
to prostitute his understanding at forty. We do not see the exact
parallel which <cite>The Courier</cite> sets up between moral repentance and
political profligacy. A man, says <cite>The Courier</cite>, may surely express
an abhorrence of his past vices, as of drunkenness. Yes; and he may
also express a great abhorrence of his present vices, because his own
opinion, as well as that of all impartial persons, condemns his conduct;
but it would be curious if a man were to express a great abhorrence
of his present opinions, and it is only a less degree of absurdity for a
man to express a great abhorrence of his past opinions; for if he was
not a hypocrite, he must have held those opinions, as he holds his
present ones, because he thought them right. A man is at liberty to
condemn his errors in practice as much as he pleases: it is a point
agreed upon. But he is not at liberty to condemn his errors in
theory at the same unmerciful rate, because many people still think
them right; because it is the height of arrogance in him to assume
his own forfeited opinion as the invariable standard of right and wrong,
and the height of indecency to ascribe the conclusions of others to
bad motives, by which he can only arraign his own. Certainly, all
the presumption of indirect and dishonest motives lies against Mr.
Southey’s unlooked-for conversion, and not against his original
principles. Will he deny this himself? He must then retract what
he says in the Quarterly Review; for he there says, that ‘the late
war was so popular for three and twenty years together, that for any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>one to be against it,’ (and much more, to be a Jacobin, as he was,
half that time,) ‘exposed him to contempt, insult, persecution, the
loss of property, and even of life.’ The odds, we grant, were
against Mr. Southey’s pure reason; they proved too much for it.
According, however, to the new theory of political integrity, to be a
steady, consistent, conscientious Whig or Tory, is nothing. It is
the change of opinion that stamps its value on it; and the more
outrageous the change, the more meritorious the stigma attached to it.
It is the sacrifice of all principle, that is the triumph of corruption; it
is the shameless effrontery of a desertion of the people, that is the
chief recommendation to the panders of a court; it is the contempt,
the grinning scorn and infamy, which is poured on all patriotism and
independence, by shewing the radical baseness and fickleness of its
professors in the most startling point of view, that strengthens the
rotten foundations of power, by degrading human nature. Poor
Bob Southey! how they laugh at him! What are the abuse and
contumely which we are in the habit of bestowing upon him,
compared with the cordial contempt, the flickering sneers, that play
round the lips of his new-fangled friends, when they see ‘the Man of
Humanity’ decked out in the trappings of his prostitution, and feel
the rankling venom of their hearts soothed by the flattering reflection
that virtue and genius are mere marketable commodities! What a
squeeze must that be which Mr. Canning gives the hand that wrote
the Sonnet to Old Sarum, and the Defence of Rotten Boroughs in
the Quarterly Review! Mr. Canning was at first suspected of being
the author of this last article: no one has attributed <cite>Wat Tyler</cite> to the
classical pen of that glib orator and consistent anti-jacobin. Yet
what are the pretensions of that gentleman’s profligate consistency
opposed to Mr. Southey’s profligate versatility; what a pitiful
spectacle does his sneaking, servile adherence to a party make,
compared with Mr. Southey’s barefaced and magnanimous desertion
of one! Mr. Canning has indeed served a cause; Mr. Southey
has betrayed one. Mr. Canning threw contempt on the cause of
liberty by his wit; Mr. Southey has done it by his want of principle.
‘This, this is the unkindest blow of all.’ We should not mind any
thing but that;—that is the reflection that stabs us:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Mr. Coleridge thinks that this triumph over himself and the Poet-laureate
is a triumph to us. God forbid! It shews that he knows
as little about us as he does about himself. This question of apostacy
may be summed up in a very few words:—First, if Mr. Southey is
not an apostate, we should like to know who ever was? Secondly,
whether the term, apostate, is a term of reproach? If it has ceased
to be so, it is another among the triumphs of the present king’s reign,
and a greater proof than any brought forward in the Quarterly Review,
of the progress of public spirit and political independence among us
of late years! A man may change his opinion. Good. But if he
changes his opinion as his interest or vanity would prompt, if he
deserts the weak to go to the stronger side, the change is a suspicious
one! and we shall have a right to impute it rather to a defect of moral
principle than to an accession of intellectual strength. Again, no
man, be he who he may, has a right to change his opinion, and to be
violent on opposite sides of a question. For the only excuse for
dogmatical intolerance is, that the person who holds an opinion is totally
blinded by habit to all objections against it, so that he can see nothing
wrong on his own side, and nothing right on the other; which cannot
be the case with any person who has been sincere in the opposite
opinion. No one, therefore, has a right to call another ‘the greatest
of scoundrels’ for holding the opinions which he himself once held,
without first formally acknowledging that he himself was the greatest
of hypocrites when he maintained those opinions. When Mr. Southey
subscribes to these conditions, we will give him a license to rail on
whom and as long as he pleases: but not—<em>till then</em>! Apostates are
violent in their opinions, because they suspect their truth, even when
they are most sincere: they are forward to vilify the motives of those
who differ from them, because their own are more than suspected by
the world! We proceed to notice the flabby defence of ‘the <cite>Wat
Tyler</cite>,’ from the well-known pen of Mr. Coleridge, which, as far as
we can understand it, proceeds upon the following assumptions:—</p>

<p class='c010'>1. <em>That Mr. Southey was only 19 when he wrote it, and had forgotten,
from that time to this, all the principles and sentiments contained in it.</em></p>

<p class='c010'><em>Answer.</em> A person who forgets all the sentiments and principles to
which he was most attached at nineteen, can have no sentiments ever
after worth being attached to. Further, it is not true that Mr.
Southey gave up the general principles of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>, which he wrote
at nineteen, till almost as many years after. He did not give them
up till many years after he had received his Irish pension in 1800.
He did not give them up till with this <em>leaning</em> to something beyond
‘the slides of his magic lanthorn,’ and ‘the pleasing fervour of his
imagination,’ he was canted out of them by the misty metaphysics of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Mr. Coleridge, Mr. Southey being no conjurer in such matters, and
Mr. Coleridge being a great quack. The dates of his works will
shew this: as it was indeed excellently well shewn in <cite>The Morning
Chronicle</cite> the other day. His Joan of Arc, his Sonnets and
Inscriptions, his Letters from Spain and Portugal, his Annual Anthology,
in which was published Mr. Coleridge’s ‘Fire, Famine,
and Slaughter,’ are a series of invectives against Kings, Priests, and
Nobles, in favour of the French Revolution, and against war and
taxes up to the year 1803. Why does he not get an injunction
against all these? To set aside all Mr. Southey’s jacobin publications,
it would be necessary to erect a new court of Chancery. Mr.
Coleridge’s insinuation, that he had changed all his opinions the year
after, when Mr. S. and Mr. C., in conjunction, wrote the Fall of
Robespierre, is, therefore, not true. But Mr. Coleridge never
troubles himself about facts or dates; he is only ‘watching the slides
of his magic lanthorn,’ and indulging in ‘the pleasing fervour of
poetical inspiration.’</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <em>That Mr. Southey was a mere boy when he wrote Wat Tyler,
and entertained Jacobin opinions: that being a child, he felt as a child,
and thought slavery, superstition, war, famine, bloodshed, taxes, bribery
and corruption, rotten boroughs, places, and pensions, shocking things; but
that now he is become a man, he has put away childish things, and thinks
there is nothing so delightful as slavery, superstition, war, famine, bloodshed,
taxes, bribery and corruption, rotten boroughs, places and pensions,
and particularly, his own.</em></p>

<p class='c010'><em>Answer.</em> Yet Mr. Coleridge tells us that when he wrote <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>,
he was a man of genius and learning. That Mr. Southey was a wise
man when he wrote this poem, we do not pretend: that he has ever
been so, is more than we know. This we do know, and it is worth
attending to; that all that Mr. Southey has done best in poetry, he
did before he changed his political creed; that <em>all</em> that Mr. Coleridge
ever did in poetry, as the <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite>, <cite>Christabel</cite>, the <cite>Three
Graves</cite>, his Poems and his Tragedy, he had written, when, according
to his own account, he must have been a very ignorant, idle, thoughtless
person; that much the greater part of what Mr. Wordsworth
has done best in poetry was done about the same period; and if what
these persons have done in poetry, in indulging the ‘pleasing fervour
of a lively imagination,’ gives no weight to their political opinions at
the time they did it, what they have done since in science or
philosophy to establish their authority, is more than we know. All
the authority that they have as poets and men of genius must be
thrown into the scale of Revolution and Reform. Their Jacobin
principles indeed gave rise to their Jacobin poetry. Since they gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>up the first, their poetical powers have flagged, and been comparatively
or wholly ‘in a state of suspended animation.’ Their genius, their
style, their versification, every thing down to their spelling, was
revolutionary. Their poetical innovations unhappily did not answer
any more than the French Revolution. As their ambition was
baulked in this first favourite direction, it was necessary for these
restless persons to do something to get into notice; as they could not
change their style, they changed their principles; and instead of
writing popular poetry, fell to scribbling venal prose.—Mr. Southey’s
opinion, like Mr. Wordsworth’s or Mr. Coleridge’s, is of no value,
except as it is his own, the unbiassed, undepraved dictate of his own
understanding and feelings; not as it is a wretched, canting, reluctant
echo of the opinion of the world. Poet-laureates are courtiers by
profession; but we say that poets are naturally Jacobins. All the
poets of the present day have been so, with a single exception, which
it would be invidious to mention. If they have not all continued so,
this only shews the instability of their own characters, and that their
natural generosity and romantic enthusiasm, ‘their lofty, imaginative,
and innocent spirits,’ have not been proof against the incessant, unwearied
importunities of vulgar ambition. The poets, we say then,
are with us, while they are worth keeping. We take the sound part
of their heads and hearts, and make Mr. Croker and the <cite>Courier</cite> a
present of the rest. What the philosophers are, let the dreaded name
of <em>modern philosophy</em> answer!</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <em>Mr. Coleridge compares us to the long-eared virtuoso, the ass, that
found Apollo’s lute, ‘left behind by him when he ascended to his own
natural place, to sit thenceforward with all the Muses around him, instead
of the ragged cattle of Admetus.’</em></p>

<p class='c010'><em>Answer.</em> Now it seems that Mr. Coleridge and other common
friends of his, such as the author of the Fall of Robespierre and of
Democratic Lectures, or Lectures on Democracy, in the year 1794,
knew a good deal of Mr. Southey before he dropped this lute.
Were they the ragged cattle of Admetus that Mr. Southey was fain
to associate with during his obscure metamorphosis and strange Jacobin
disguise? Did the Coleridges, the Wordsworths, the Lloyds and
Lambs and Co. precede the Hunts, the Hazlitts, and the Cobbetts,
in listening to Mr. Southey ‘tuning his mystic harp to praise Lepaux,’
the Parisian Theophilanthropist? And is it only since Mr. Southey
has sat ‘quiring to the young-eyed cherubim,’ with the Barrymores,
the Crokers, the Giffords, and the Stroehlings, that his natural genius
and moral purity of sentiment have found their proper level and
reward? Be this as it may, we plead guilty to the charge of some
little indiscreet admiration of the Apollo of Jacobinism. We did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>not however find his lute three and twenty years after he had dropped
it ‘in a thistle.’ We saw it in his hands. We heard him with our
own ears play upon it, loud and long; and we can swear he was as
well satisfied with his own music as we could be. ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Asinos asinina
decent</span></i>,’—a bad compliment, in the style of <em>Dogberry</em>, which Mr. C.
pays to his friend and to himself, as one of his early ragged auditors.
Now whether Mr. Southey has since that period ascended to heaven
or descended to the earth, we shall leave it to Mr. Coleridge himself
to decide. For he says, that at the time when the present poet-laureate
wrote <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>, he (Mr. Southey) was ‘a young man full
of glorious visions concerning the possibilities of human nature,
because his lofty, imaginative, and innocent spirit, had mistaken its
own virtues and powers for the average character of mankind.’—Since
Mr. Southey went to court, he has changed his tone. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Asinos
asinina decent.</span></i> Is that Mr. Coleridge’s political logic?<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c011'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>4. <em>That Mr. Southey did not express his real opinions, even at that
time, in Wat Tyler, which is a dramatic poem, in which mob-orators and
rioters figure, with appropriate sentiments, as Jack Cade may do in
Shakespear.</em></p>

<p class='c010'><em>Answer.</em> This allusion to the dramatic characters of Shakespear
is certainly unfortunate, and Mr. Coleridge himself hints as much.
Rioters and mob-preachers are not the only persons who appear in
‘the <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>.’ The King and the Archbishop come forward in
their own persons, according to Mr. Coleridge, with appropriate
sentiments, labelled and put into their mouths. For example:—</p>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'><em>Archbishop.</em> Aye, that my liege</div>
      <div class='line'>Were politic. Go boldly forth to meet them,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grant all they ask—however wild and ruinous;—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Meantime, the troops you have already summoned</div>

      <div class='line'>Would soon disperse.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The very burden of <cite>The Courier</cite> all last week, and for many weeks
last past and to come.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. Mr. Coleridge sums up his opinion of the ultimate design and
secret origin of ‘the <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>’ in these remarkable words:—‘We
should have seen that the vivid, yet indistinct images in which he had
painted the evils of war and the hardships of the poor, proved that
neither the forms nor the feelings were the result of real observation.
The product of the poet’s own fancy, they’—[<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> the evils of war
and the hardships of the poor]—‘were impregnated, therefore, with
<em>that pleasurable fervour which is experienced in all energetic exertion of
intellectual power</em>. But as to any serious wish, akin to reality,’ [that
is, to remove these evils] ‘as to any real persons or events designed
or expected, we should think it just as wise and just as charitable,
to believe that Quevedo or Dante would have been glad to realise
the horrid phantoms and torments of <em>imaginary</em> oppressors, whom
they beheld in the infernal regions—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> on the slides of their own
magic lanthorn.’</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Answer.</em> The slides of the guillotine, excited (as we have been
told) the same pleasurable fervour in Mr. Southey’s mind: and
Mr. Coleridge seems to insinuate, that the 5,800,000 lives which
have been lost to prove mankind the property of kings, by divine
right, have been lost ‘on the slides of a magic lanthorn’; the evils
of war, like all other actual evils, being ‘the products of a fervid
imagination.’ So much for the sincerity of poetry.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Audrey.</em> Is not poetry a true thing?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Touchstone.</em> No.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Would these gentlemen persuade us that there is nothing evil in the
universe but what exists in their imagination, but what is the product
of their fervid fancy? That the world is full of nothing but their
egotism, their vanity, and their hypocrisy? The world is <em>sick</em> of
them, their egotism, their vanity, and their hypocrisy.</p>

<p class='c010'>6th and lastly. ‘Mr. Southey’s darling poet from his childhood
was Edmund Spenser, from whom, next to the spotless purity of his
own moral habits, he learned that reverence for</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>—— ——“constant chastity,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unspotted faith, and comely womanhood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Regard of honour and mild modesty.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>‘And we are strongly persuaded that the indignation which, in his
early perusal of our history, the outrage on <em>Wat Tyler’s</em> Daughter
had kindled within him, was the circumstance that recommended
the story to his choice for the first powerful exercise of his dramatic
powers. It is this, too, we doubt not, that coloured and shaped his
feelings during the whole composition of the drama.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Through the allegiance and just fealty</div>
      <div class='line'>Which he did owe unto all womankind.”’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Coleridge might as well tell us that the Laureate wrote <cite>Wat
Tyler</cite> as an Epithalamium on his own marriage. There is but one
line on the subject from the beginning to the end. No; it is not
Mr. Southey’s way to say nothing on the subject on which he writes.
If this were the main drift and secret spring of the poem, why does
Mr. Southey wish to retract it now? Has he been taught by his
present fashionable associates to laugh at Edmund Spenser, the darling
of the <em>boy</em> Southey, to abjure ‘his allegiance and just fealty to all
womankind,’ and to look upon ‘rapes and ravishments’ as ‘exaggerated
evils,’ the product of an idle imagination, exciting a
pleasurable fervour at the time, and signifying nothing afterwards?
Is the outrage upon <em>Wat Tyler’s</em> Daughter the only evil in history,
or in the poem itself, which ought to inflame the virtuous indignation
of the full-grown stripling bard? Are all the other oppressions
recorded in the annals of the world nothing but ‘horrible shadows,
unreal mockeries,’ that this alone should live ‘within the book and
volume of his brain unmixed with baser matter’? Or has Mr.
Southey, the historian and the politician, at last discovered, that even
this evil, the greatest and the only evil in the world, and not a mere
illusion of his boyish imagination, is itself a bagatelle, compared with
the blessings of the poll-tax, feudal vassalage, popery, and slavery,
the attempt to put down which by murder, insurrection, and treason,
in the reign of Richard <span class='fss'>II.</span> the poet-laureate once celebrated <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con
amore</span></i> in ‘the <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>‘?—In courtly malice and servility Mr.
Southey has outdone Herodias’s daughter. He marches into
Chancery ‘with his own head in a charger,’ as an offering to Royal
delicacy. He plucks out the heart of Liberty within him, and
mangles his own breast to stifle every natural sentiment left there:
and yet Mr. Coleridge would persuade us that this stuffed figure, this
wretched phantom, is the living man. The finery of birth-day suits
has dazzled his senses, so that he has ‘no speculation in those eyes
that he does glare with’; yet Mr. Coleridge would persuade us that
this is the clear-sighted politician. Famine stares him in the face,
and he looks upon her with lack-lustre eye. Despotism hovers over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>him, and he says, ‘Come, let me clutch thee.’ He drinks the cup
of human misery, and thinks it is a cup of sack. He has no feeling
left, but of ‘tickling commodity’; no ears but for court whispers;
no understanding but of his interest; no passion but his vanity. And
yet they would persuade us that this non-entity is somebody—‘the
chief dread of Jacobins and Jacobinism, or quacks and quackery.’
If so, Jacobins and Jacobinism have not much to fear; and Mr.
Coleridge may publish as many Lay Sermons as he pleases.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is but one statement in the article in <cite>The Courier</cite> to which
we can heartily assent; it is Mr. Southey’s prediction of the fate of
the French Revolution. ‘The Temple of Despotism,’ he said,
‘would be rebuilt, like that of the Mexican God, with human skulls,
and cemented with human blood.’ He has lived to see this; to
assist in the accomplishment of his prophecy, and to consecrate the
spectre-building with pensioned hands!</p>

<h3 class='c003'><span class='sc'>A Letter to William Smith, Esq.</span>, M.P. <em>from</em> Robert Southey, <em>Esq.</em> John Murray, Albemarle-street. 1817. <em>Price</em> 2<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i></h3>

</div>

<p class='c013'>This is very unlike Mr. Burke’s celebrated ‘Letter to the Duke of
Bedford.’ The last is the only work of the Irish orator and patriot,
in which he was in earnest, and all that he wanted was sincerity.
The attack made upon his pension, by rousing his self-love, kindled
his imagination, and made him blaze out in a torrent of fiery eloquence,
in the course of which his tilting prose-Pegasus darted upon the titles
of the noble duke like a thunderbolt, reversed his ancestral honours,
overturned the monstrous straddle-legged figure of that legitimate
monarch, Henry <span class='fss'>VIII.</span>, exploded the mines of the French revolution,
kicked down the Abbé Sieyes’s pigeon-holes full of constitutions, and
only reposed from his whirling career, in that fine retrospect on himself,
and the affecting episode to Admiral Keppel. Mr. Burke was an
apostate, ‘a malignant renegado,’ like Mr. Southey; but there the
comparison ends. He would not have been content, on such an
occasion as the present, with <em>Mistering</em> his opponent, and <em>Esquiring</em>
himself, like the ladies in the Beggar’s Opera, who express the
height of their rankling envy and dislike, by calling each other—<em>Madam</em>.
Mr. Southey’s self-love, when challenged to the lists, does
not launch out into the wide field of wit or argument: it retires into
its own littleness, collects all its slender resources in one poor effort of
pert, pettifogging spite, makes up by studied malice for conscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>impotence, and attempts to mortify others by the angry sense of his
own insignificance. He grows tenacious of his ridiculous pretensions,
in proportion as they are given up by every body else. His self-complacency
riots, with a peculiar and pointed gusto, in the universal
contempt or compassion of friends and foes. In the last stage of a
galloping consumption, while the last expiring puff of <cite>The Courier</cite>
makes ‘a swan-like end,’ in a compliment to his opponents, he is
sanguine of a deathless reputation—considers his soreness to the least
touch as a proof of his being in a whole skin, and his uneasiness to
repel every attack as a proof of his being invulnerable. In a word,
he mistakes an excess of spleen and irritability for the consciousness
of innocence, and sets up his own egotism, vanity, ill-humour, and
intolerance, as an answer in full to all the objections which have been
brought against him of vanity, egotism, malignity, and intolerance.
His ‘Letter’ is a concentrated essence of a want of self-knowledge.
It is the picture of the author’s mind in little. In this respect, it is ‘a
psychological curiosity’; a study of human infirmity. As some
persons bequeath their bodies to the surgeons to be dissected after
their death, Mr. Southey publicly exposes his mind to be anatomized
while he is living. He lays open his character to the scalping-knife,
guides the philosophic hand in its painful researches, and on the bald
crown of our <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">petit tondu</span></i>, in vain concealed under withered bay-leaves
and a few contemptible grey hairs, you see the organ of vanity
triumphant—sleek, smooth, round, perfect, polished, horned, and
shining, as it were in a transparency. This is the handle of his
intellect, the index of his mind; ‘the guide, the anchor of his purest
thoughts, and soul of all his moral being’; the clue to the labyrinth
of all his tergiversations and contradictions; the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">medius terminus</span></i> of
his political logic.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once admit that Mr. Southey is always in the right, and every one
else in the wrong, and all the rest follows. This at once reconciles
‘Wat Tyler’ and the ‘Quarterly Review,’ which Mr. William
Smith took down to the House, in two different pockets for fear of
a breach of the peace; identifies the poet of the ‘Joan of Arc’ and
of the ‘Annual Anthology’ with the poet-laureate; and <em>jumps</em> the
stripling into the man, whenever the latter has a mind to jump into a
place or pension. Till you can deprive him of his personal identity,
he will always be the same infallible person—in his own opinion.
He is both judge and jury in his own cause; the sole standard of
right and wrong. To differ with him is inexcusable; for ‘there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>but one perfect, even himself.’ He is the central point of all moral
and intellectual excellence; the way, the truth, and the life. There
is no salvation out of his pale; and yet he makes the terms of communion
so strict, that there is no hope that way. The crime of Mr.
William Smith and others, against whom this high-priest of impertinence
levels his anathemas, is <em>in not being</em> Mr. Southey. What is
right in him, is wrong in them; what is the height of folly or
wickedness in them, is, ‘as fortune and the flesh shall serve,’ the
height of wisdom and virtue in him; for there is no medium in his
reprobation of others and approbation of himself. Whatever he does,
is proper: whatever he thinks, is true and profound: ‘I, Robert
Shallow, Esquire, have said it.’ Whether Jacobin or Anti-jacobin,
Theophilanthropist or Trinitarian, Spencean, or Ex-Spencean, the
patron of Universal Suffrage or of close Boroughs, of the reversion
of sinecure places, and pensions, or of the abolition of all property,—however
extreme in one opinion or another, he alone is in the
right; and those who do not think as he does, and change their
opinions as he does, and go the lengths that he does, first on one side
and then on the other, are necessarily knaves and fools. Wherever
he sits, is the head of the table. Truth and justice are always at his
side. The wise and virtuous are always with him. How should it
be otherwise? He calls those ‘wise and virtuous’ who are of his
way of thinking; the rest are ‘sciolists, profligates, and coxcombs.’
By a fiction of his own making, not by a fiction of the law, Mr.
Southey can do no wrong; and to accuse him of it, is a libel on the
face of it, and little short of high treason. It is not the poet-laureate,
the author of ‘Wat Tyler’ and of the ‘Quarterly Review,’ who is to
blame for his violence and apostacy; with that portion of self-sufficiency
which this author possesses, ‘these are most virtuous’;
but it is the person who brings forward the contradictions and
intemperance of these two performances who is never to be forgiven
for questioning Mr. Southey’s consistency and moderation. All this
is strange, but not new to our readers. We have said it all before.
Why does Mr. Southey oblige us to repeat the accusation, by furnishing
us with fresh proofs of it? He is betrayed to his ruin by trusting
to the dictates of his personal feelings and wounded pride; and yet
he dare not look at his situation through any other medium. ‘To
know my deed, ‘t were best not know myself.’ But does he expect
all eyes as well as his to be ‘blind with the pin and web’? Does he
pull his laurel-crown as a splendid film over his eyes, and expect us
to join in a game of political blindman’s-buff with him, with a ‘Hoop,
do me no harm, good man’? Are we not to cry out while an
impudent, hypocritical, malignant renegado is putting his gag in our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>mouths, and getting his thumb-screws ready? ‘Dost thou think,
because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale,’ says
<em>Sir Toby</em> to the fantastical steward <em>Malvolio</em>? Does Mr. Southey
think, because he is a pensioner, that he is to make us willing slaves?
While he goes on writing in the ‘Quarterly,’ shall we give over
writing in <cite>The Examiner</cite>? Before he puts down the liberty of the
press, the press shall put him down, with all his hireling and changeling
crew. In the <em>servile war</em> which Mr. Southey tells us is
approaching, the service we have proposed to ourselves to do is, to
neutralize the servile intellect of the country. This we have already
done in part, and hope to make clear work of it, before we have done.—For
example:</p>

<p class='c010'>This heroic epistle to William Smith, Esq. from Robert Southey,
sets off in the following manner:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—You are represented in the newspapers as having entered,
during an important discussion in parliament, into a comparison
between certain passages in the ‘Quarterly Review,’ and the opinions
which were held by the author of ‘Wat Tyler’ three-and-twenty
years ago. It appears farther, according to the same authority, that
the introduction of so strange a criticism, in so strange a place, did
not arise from the debate, but was a premeditated thing; that you had
prepared yourself for it, by stowing the ‘Quarterly Review’ in one
pocket, and ‘Wat Tyler’ in the other; and that you deliberately
stood up for the purpose of reviling an individual who was not present
to vindicate himself, and in a place which afforded you protection.’
p. 2.</p>

<p class='c010'>So that for Mr. William Smith in a debate on a bill <em>for the suppression
of all political opinions</em> (as we are told by Mr. Alderman
Smith, a very different person, to be sure, and according to Mr.
Southey, no doubt, a highly respectable character, and a true lover
of liberty and the constitution) for Mr. William Smith on such an
occasion to introduce the sentiments of a well-known writer in a public
journal, that writer being a whiffling tool of the court, and that
journal the avowed organ of the government-party, in confirmation of
his apprehensions of the objects and probable results of the bill then
pending, was quite irrelevant and unparliamentary; nor had Mr.
William Smith any right to set an additional stigma on the unprincipled
and barefaced lengths which this writer now goes in servility and
intolerance, by shewing the equal lengths to which he went formerly
in popular fanaticism and licentiousness. Yet neither Mr. Southey
nor his friend Mr. Wynne complained of Mr. Canning’s want of
regularity, or disrespect of the House, in lugging out of his pocket
<span class='sc'>The Spencean Plan</span> as an argument against Reform, and as decisive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>of the views of the Friends of Reform in parliament. Nay, Mr.
Southey requoted Mr. Canning’s quotation, for the purpose of reviling
all Reform and all Reformers, in the ‘Quarterly Review’;—a place
in which any one so reviled can no more defend himself than Mr.
Southey can defend himself in parliament; and which it seems affords
equal ‘protection’ to those who avail themselves of it; for a
Quarterly Reviewer, according to Mr. Southey, being anonymous,
is not at all accountable for what he writes. He says,—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘As to the “Quarterly Review,” you can have no other authority
for ascribing any particular paper in that journal to one person or to
another, than common report. The “Quarterly Review” stands
upon its own merits.’ [Yet it was for what Mr. Southey wrote in
that Review, that <cite>The Courier</cite> told us at the time that Mr. Southey
was made Poet-laureate.] ‘What I may have said or thought in any
part of my life, no more concerns that journal than it does you or the
House of Commons.’ [What Mr. Southey has said publicly any
where in any part of his life, concerns the public and every man in it,
unless Mr. Southey means to say that his opinions are utterly worthless
and contemptible, a piece of modesty of which we cannot suspect
him.] ‘What I have written in it is a question which you, Sir, have
no right to ask, and which certainly I will not answer. As little
right have you to take that for granted which you cannot possibly
know.’ Now mark. In the very paragraph before the one in which
he skulks from the responsibility of the ‘Quarterly Review,’ and with
pert vapid assurance repels every insinuation implying a breach of his
inviolability as an anonymous writer, he makes an impudent, unqualified,
and virulent attack on Mr. Brougham as an Edinburgh Reviewer,
‘This was not necessary in regard to Mr. Brougham&nbsp;... <em>he only
carried the quarrels as well as the practices of the Edinburgh Review
into the House of Commons. But as calumny, Sir, has not been your
vocation</em>, it may be useful, even to yourself, if I comment upon your
first attempt.’—p. 3. Such a want of common logic is to our literal
capacities quite inexplicable: it is ‘in the third tier of wonders above
wonders.’</p>

<p class='c010'>In page 5, Mr. Southey calls the person who published ‘Wat
Tyler’ ‘a skulking scoundrel,’ with his characteristic delicacy and
moderation in the use of epithets; and says that it was published,
‘for the avowed purpose of insulting him, and with the hope of
injuring him if possible.’ Perhaps one object was to prevent Mr.
Southey from insulting and injuring other people. It was supposed
that ‘Wat Tyler’ might prove an antidote to the ‘Quarterly Review’:
that, ‘the healing might come from the same weapon that gave the
wound’; and in this instance it has turned out so. He adds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>‘You knew that the transaction bore upon its face every character of
baseness and malignity. You knew that it must have been effected
either by robbery, or by breach of trust. <em>These things, Mr. William
Smith, you knew!</em>’ [Mr. Southey at least knows no such thing, but
he is here in his glory; putting a false statement into epigrammatic
phraseology; bristling with horror at antithetical enormities of his
own fabricating, and concluding with that formidable and significant
repetition of the title, Christian and surname of <em>Mr. William Smith</em>.]
The above paragraph concludes thus, with the author’s usual logical
precision and personal modesty. ‘And knowing them as you did, I
verily believe, that if it were possible to revoke what is irrevocable,
you would <em>at this moment</em> be far more desirous of blotting from
remembrance the <em>disgraceful</em> speech which stands upon record in your
name, than I should be of cancelling the boyish composition which
gave rise to it. “Wat Tyler” is full of errors ... but they are
the errors of youth and ignorance; they bear no indication of an
ungenerous spirit, or of a malevolent heart.’ p. 6. It seems by this
passage that any attempt to fix disgrace on Mr. Southey only, recoils
upon the head of his accuser. ‘Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit.’
He says that Mr. W. Smith’s <em>disgraceful</em> speech was occasioned by
‘Wat Tyler.’ That is not true. It was occasioned by ‘Wat Tyler’
coupled with the ‘Quarterly Review.’ He says, ‘“Wat Tyler” is
full of errors.’ So is the article in the ‘Quarterly Review’; but
<em>they</em> are not ‘the errors of youth and ignorance; they bear strong
indications of an ungenerous spirit and a malignant heart.’ Let not
Mr. Southey mistake. It is not the indiscreet and romantic
extravagance of the boy which has brought the man into this predicament:
it is the deliberate and rancorous servility of the man that
has made those who were the marks of his slanderous and cowardly
invectives, rake up the errors of his youth against him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Southey next proceeds to a defence of himself for writing ‘the
Wat Tyler.’ He argues that ‘it is not <em>seditious</em>, because it is <em>dramatic</em>.’
We deny that it is dramatic. He acknowledges that it is mischievous,
and particularly so, at the present time. To the last part of the
proposition we cannot assent. When this poem was written, there
was a rage of speculation which might be dangerous: the danger at
present arises from the rage of hunger. And the true reason why
Mr. Southey was eager to suppress this publication was not what he
pretends, a fear that it might inculcate notions of perfect equality and
general licentiousness: but a feeling that it might prevent him from
defending every abuse of excessive inequality, and every stretch of
arbitrary power, the end of which must be to sink ‘the people’ in an
abyss of slavery, and to plunge ‘the populace’ in the depths of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>famine, despair, and misery, or by a sudden and tremendous revulsion,
to occasion all that confusion, anarchy, violence, and bloodshed,
which Mr. Southey hypocritically affects to deprecate as the consequences
of seditious and inflammatory publications. Now we
contend in opposition to Mr. Southey and all that servile crew, that
the only possible preventive of one or other of these impending evils,
namely, lasting slavery, famine, and general misery on the one hand,
or a sudden and dreadful convulsion on the other, is the liberty of the
press, which Mr. Southey calls sedition, and the firm, manly, and
independent expression of public opinion, which he calls rebellion.
We detest despotism: we deprecate popular commotion: but if we
are forced upon an alternative, we have a choice: we prefer temporary
to lasting evils. Mr. Southey has indeed a new-acquired and therefore
lively dread of the horrors of revolution. But his passion for
despotism is greater than his dread of anarchy; and he runs all the
risks of the one, rather than not glut his insatiable and unnatural
appetite for the other. Such are his politics, and such are ours. He
says, ‘The piece was written under the influence of opinions which I
have long since outgrown, and repeatedly disclaimed, but for which
I have never felt either shame or contrition. They were taken up
conscientiously in early youth, they were acted upon in disregard of
all worldly considerations, <em>and they were left behind in the same strait-forward</em>
<em>course, as I advanced in years</em>.’ The latter part of this
statement is not self-evident. Mr. Southey says that while he
adhered to his first principles, he acted with a total disregard of his
worldly interest; and this is easily understood:—but that his desertion
of those principles, so contrary to his worldly views, was equally
independent, disinterested and free from sinister motives, is not so
plain. Nor can we take Mr. Southey’s word for it. And we will
tell him the reason. If he had been <em>progressive</em>, as he calls it, in his
course, up to the year 1814, we should not have found much fault
with him: but why did he become stationary then? Has nothing
happened in the three last years,—nothing—to make Mr. Southey
retreat back to some of his old opinions, as he had advanced from
them, guided, as he professes to be in his undeviating course, by facts
and experience? Are the actual events of the last three years
nothing in the scale of Mr. Southey’s judgment? Is not their
weight overpowering, irresistible? What, do not the names of Poland,
Norway, Finland, Saxony, Italy, Spain and Portugal, the Pope, the
Inquisition, and the Cortes (to say nothing of France, Nismes, and
the Bourbons) thrown into the scale of common sense and common
honesty, dash it down, with a startling sound, upon the counter,
where Mr. Southey is reckoning his well-gotten gains, the price of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>his disinterested exertions in the cause of Spanish liberty and the
deliverance of mankind, making his hair stand on end at his own
folly and credulity, and forcing him indignantly to fling his last year’s
pension and the arrears of the Quarterly in the face of Mr. Murray’s
shopmen and the clerks of the Treasury, and swear, ‘in disregard of
all worldly considerations,’ never to set his foot in Downing or
Albemarle-street again? No such thing. In advocating the cause
of the French people, Mr. Southey’s principles and his interest were
at variance, and therefore he quitted his principles when he saw a
good opportunity: in taking up the cause of the Allies, his principles
and his interest became united and thenceforth indissoluble. His
engagement to his first love, the Republic, was only upon liking; his
marriage to Legitimacy is <em>for better, for worse</em>, and nothing but death
shall part them. Our simple Laureate was sharp upon his hoyden
Jacobin mistress, who brought him no dowry, neither place nor
pension, who ‘found him poor and kept him so,’ by her prudish
notions of virtue. He divorced her, in short, for nothing but the
spirit and success with which she resisted the fraud and force to
which the old bawd Legitimacy was forever resorting to overpower
her resolution and fidelity. He said she was a virago, a cunning
gipsey, always in broils about her honour and the inviolability of her
person, and always getting the better in them, furiously scratching the
face or cruelly tearing off the hair of the said pimping old lady, who
would never let her alone, night or day. But since her foot slipped
one day on the ice, and the detestable old hag tripped up her heels,
and gave her up to the kind keeping of the Allied Sovereigns, Mr.
Southey has devoted himself to her more fortunate and wealthy rival:
he is become uxorious in his second matrimonial connexion; and
though his false Duessa has turned out a very witch, a foul, ugly
witch, drunk with insolence, mad with power, a griping, rapacious
wretch, bloody, luxurious, wanton, malicious, not sparing steel, or
poison, or gold, to gain her ends—bringing famine, pestilence, and
death in her train—infecting the air with her thoughts, killing the
beholders with her looks, claiming mankind as her property, and
using them as her slaves—driving every thing before her, and playing
the devil wherever she comes, Mr. Southey sticks to her in spite of
every thing, and for very shame lays his head in her lap, paddles with
the palms of her hands, inhales her hateful breath, leers in her eyes
and whispers in her ears, calls her little fondling names, Religion,
Morality, and Social Order, takes for his motto,</p>

life? The early Protestant Divines wrote such prodigious long

<p class='c010'>Has Mr. Murray turned Quaker, that he styles himself John
Murray (‘Mark you his absolute John?‘) in the title-page? Or
has Mr. Southey resigned his place and his pretensions, that he omits
in the same page his honorary titles of Poet-Laureate and Member of
the Royal Spanish Academy? We cannot tell; but we should think
it some sign of grace, if, without a hint from the Lord Chamberlain,
he had for a while laid by his tattered laurel and spattered birth-day
suit: if, as the Commander in Chief retired after the droll affair of
Mrs. Clarke (we are not such rigid moralists as Mr. Southey) the
Poet-Laureate had thought proper to veil his blushing court favours
during the dramatic representation of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>, and did not consider
it either prudent or becoming to be seen going to or coming
from Carlton-house with the mob, ‘the reading rabble,’ at his heels,
and with a shower of twopenny pamphlets sticking to the skirts of
his turned coat. Poor <em>Morgan</em>, the honest Welchman in <cite>Roderic
Random</cite>, reeking with the fumes of tobacco and garlic, was not more
offensive to the sensitive organs of <em>Captain Whiffle</em>, than Mr. Southey
must be to the nice feelings of an exalted Personage, reeking with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>the fumes of Jacobinism, and rolled, as he has been, in the kennel of
the newspaper press. A voyage to Italy, a classical quarantine of a
year or two, with the Pope’s blessing, seems absolutely necessary to
wipe out the stains of his <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>, ‘as pure as sin with baptism’;
and to restore him to the vows of Prince and People as smug as a
young novice in a monastery, and sweet as any waiting-gentlewoman.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Southey says, in continuation of his Defence of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>,
p. 7, ‘It was written when republicanism was confined to a very
small number of the educated classes:’ [Is it more common now
among the intended hearers of Mr. Coleridge’s Second and Third
Lay-Sermons?]—‘when those who were known to entertain such
opinions were exposed to personal danger from <em>the populace</em>‘; [The
populace of course were not set on by the higher classes, the clergy
or gentry, nor can Mr. S. mean to include the Attorney-General of
that day, my Lord Eldon, as one of <em>the populace</em>.] ‘And when a
spirit of anti-jacobinism was predominant, which I cannot characterise
more truly than by saying that it was as unjust and intolerant, though
not quite as ferocious, <em>as the Jacobinism of the present day</em>.’—Why not
the <em>anti-jacobinism</em> of the present day? ‘The collusion holds in the
exchange.’ The business is carried on to the present hour; and
though it has changed hands, the principal of the firm is still the
same. Mr. Gifford, the present Editor of the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>,
where Mr. Southey now writes, was formerly the Editor of the <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite>
newspaper, where he was written at. The above passage is
however a sly passing hit at Mr. Canning’s parodies, who (shame to
say it) was as wise and as witty three and twenty years ago as he is
now, and has not been making that progressive improvement ever
since, on which Mr. Southey compliments himself, congratulates his
friends, and insults over his enemies! How nicely this gentleman
<em>differences</em> himself from all his contemporaries, Jacobin or anti-Jacobin!
No one can come up to him at all points. ‘The lovely Marcia
towers above her sex!’</p>

<p class='c010'>The Letter-writer goes on to say:—‘When therefore Mr. Smith
informed the House of Commons that the author of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite> thinks
no longer upon certain points as he did in his youth, he informed
that legislative assembly of nothing more than what the author has
shown during very many years, <em>in the course of his writings</em> ...
that while events have been moving on upon the great theatre of
human affairs, <em>his intellect has not been stationary</em>.’—[Mr. S. here confounds
a change of opinions with the progress of intellect, a mistake
which we shall correct presently.]—‘But when the Member for
Norwich asserts that I impute evil motives to men merely for holding
the same doctrines’ [No, only a tenth part of the same doctrines]
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>‘which I myself formerly professed, and when he charges me with
the malignity and baseness of a Renegade, the assertion and the
charge are as false, as the language in which they are conveyed is
coarse and insulting.’ p. 9.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now we know of no writings of Mr. Southey’s, in the course of
which he had shewn for many years the change or progress of his
opinions, but in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> and other anonymous publications.
We suppose he will hardly say that his Birth-day Odes, the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carmen Nuptiale</span></i>, &amp;c. have shewn the progress of his intellect. But
in the same anonymous writings, in which the public would find, to
Mr. Southey’s credit, that his intellect had not been stationary, the
Member for Norwich would find what was not so much to his credit,
but all that was wanting to make good the charge—that Mr. Southey’s
moderation and charity to those whose intellects had been stationary,
did not keep pace with the progress of his own—for in the articles in
the <cite>Quarterly</cite>, which he claims or disclaims as he pleases, he, the
writer of the Inscription on Old Sarum, describes ‘a Reformer as no
better than a housebreaker’: he, the writer of the Inscription at
Chepstow Castle, calls all those who do not bow their necks to the
doctrine of Divine Right, Rebels and Regicides: he, the author of
<cite>Wat Tyler</cite>, calls those persons who think taxes, wars, the wanton
waste of the resources of a country, and the unfeeling profligacy of
the rich, likely to aggravate and rouse to madness the intolerable
sufferings of the poor, ‘flagitious incendiaries, panders to insurrection,
murder, and treason, and the worst of scoundrels’; he, the equalizer
of all property and of popular representation, would protect the
holders of rotten boroughs and of entailed sinecures, by shutting up
all those who write against them in solitary confinement, without pen,
ink, or paper, to answer the unanswerable arguments of Mr. Southey—in
short, the author of the articles in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, if he
was not always a base and malignant sycophant, shews himself to be
a base and malignant Renegade, by defending all the rotten, and
undermining all the sound parts of the system to which he professes
to be a convert, and by consigning over to a ‘vigour beyond the law’
all those who expose his unprincipled, pragmatical tergiversations, or
would maintain the system itself, without maintaining those corruptions
and abuses, which were all that Mr. Southey at one time saw
to hold up to execration in the English Constitution, and are all that
he now sees to admire and revere in it. This is as natural in a
Renegado, as it would be unaccountable in any one else.</p>

<p class='c010'>We must get on a little faster, for to expose the absurdities of this
Letter one by one would fill ‘a nice little book.’ In the pages
immediately following, Mr. Southey glances at the Editor of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span><cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, whom he condemns ‘to bear a <i><span lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">gore sinister tenné</span></i>
in his escutcheon,’ for saying that Mr. Southey does not form an
exception to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">irritabile genus vatum</span></i>. He says, that he has often
refrained from exposing the ignorance and inconsistency of his
opponents, as well as ‘that moral turpitude,’ which, our readers
must by this time perceive, can hardly fail to accompany any difference
of opinion with him. He says that ‘he has a talent for satire,
but that (good soul!) he has long since subdued the disposition.’
This must be since writing the last <cite>Quarterly</cite>: we thought there
were some shrewd hits there, and we suspect Sir Richard Phillips,
whom he laughs at for his dislike of war and of animal food, for
pages together, will be of our opinion. He says that ‘he has been
lately employed, while among the mountains of Cumberland, upon
the Mines of Brazil and the War in the Peninsula.’</p>

<p class='c013'>‘His <em>name</em>, in the mean time, has served in London for the very
shuttlecock of discussion.’ Why should not his name be a shuttlecock,
when he himself is no better?—‘He has impeded the rising
reputation of Toby, the Sapient Pig;’—has overlaid the posthumous
birth of the young Shiloh, and perhaps prevented Mr. Coleridge’s
premature deliverance of his last <cite>Lay Sermon</cite>. After all these misfortunes,
the author makes merry with Bonaparte’s ‘having been
exposed, like Bishop Hatto, to be devoured by the rats!’ The
levelling rogue cares neither for Bishops nor Emperors, but grows
grave again in recounting the retrograde progress of his own mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘In my youth, when my stock of knowledge consisted of such an
acquaintance with Greek and Roman history, as is acquired in the
course of a regular scholastic education,’—[The Greek and Roman
history is as good as the history of rotten boroughs or the reign of
George <span class='fss'>III.</span>]—‘when my heart was full of poetry and romance,—[Is
it so no longer?]—‘and Lucan and Akenside were at my tongue’s
end.’—[Instead of the red book and the court calendar]—‘<em>I fell into</em>
the political opinions which the French Revolution was then scattering
throughout Europe:’ [We have here a pretty fair account of the
origin and genealogy of the opinions of the French Revolution,
which opinions of liberty, truth, and justice, neither the French
Revolution shall destroy, nor those who destroyed <em>it</em>, because it was
produced by and gave birth to those opinions; and does Mr. Southey
suppose that the suppression of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite> is to suppress those opinions,
and that a lying article in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> is to persuade us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>that they who made war on those opinions from the beginning (and
by so doing, produced all the evils of those opinions, produced them
purposely, in the malice of their hearts and the darkness of their
minds produced them to destroy all liberty, truth, and justice, and to
keep mankind their slaves in perpetuity by right divine) were right
from the beginning, that they deserved well of mankind, that their
boasted triumph, the triumph of kings over the species, is ours and
Mr. Southey’s triumph? Or would he persuade us that the Greek
and Roman History has become obsolete, because Mr. Southey left
school three and twenty years ago; that poetry and romance were
banished from the human heart when he took a place and pension;
that Lucan and Akenside will not live as long as <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>, or the
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>!—We broke off in an interesting part. Mr.
Southey proceeds:]—‘Following those opinions with ardour wherever
they led.’ [This is an old trick of the author, he is a keen sportsman;]
‘I soon perceived that inequalities of rank were a light
evil compared to the inequalities of property,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c011'><sup>[36]</sup></a> and those more
fearful distinctions which the want of moral and intellectual culture
occasions between man and man. At that time, and with those
opinions or rather feelings (for their root was in the heart, and not
in the understanding) I wrote <cite>Wat Tyler</cite> as one who was impatient
of “all the oppressions that are done under the sun.”’ [Here we
must make another full stop.] Mr. Southey is incapable of forming
any other opinions but from his feelings: he never had any other
opinions, he never will have any others, worth a rush. When the
opinions he professes ceased to be the dictates of his heart, they
became the dictates of his vanity and interest; they became good for
nothing. When the first ebullition of youthful ardour was over, his
understanding was not competent to maintain its independence against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>the artifices of sophistry, aided by the accumulating force of ‘worldly
considerations,’ showy or substantial, the long neglect of which he
had felt to his cost. Mr. Southey’s pure reason was not steady
enough to contemplate the truth in an unprejudiced and unimpassioned
point of view. His imagination first ran away with his understanding;
and now, that he is getting old, his convenience, the
influence of fashion, and the tide of opinion, rush in, and fill up all
the void both of sense and imagination, driving him into the very
vortex of court-sycophancy, the sinks and common sewers of corruption.
Mr. Southey is not a man to hear reason at any time of his
life. He thinks his change of opinion is owing to an increase of
knowledge, because he has in fact no idea of any progress in intellect
but exchanging one error for another. He has no idea that a man
may grow wiser in the same opinion by discovering new reasons for
the faith that is in him; for Mr. Southey has no reasons for the
faith that is in him. He does not see how a man may devote
his whole life to the discovery of the principle of the most common
truth; for he has no principles of thought, either to guide, enlarge,
or modify his knowledge. He has nothing to shew for the wisdom
of his opinions but his own opinion of their wisdom: they are mere
self-opinions: he considers his present notions as profound and solid,
because his former ones were hasty and shallow; asserts them with
pert, vapid assurance, because he does not see the objections against
them; and thinks he must be right in his premises in proportion to
the violence and extravagance of his conclusions. Because when he
wrote <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>, he was ‘impatient of all the oppressions that are
done under the sun,’ he now thinks it his bounden duty to justify
them all, with equal impatience of contradiction. Mr. Southey does
not know himself so well as we do; and a greater confirmation of
his ignorance in this respect cannot well be given than the rest of the
above passage. ‘The subject of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite> was injudiciously chosen;
and it was treated as might be expected by a youth of twenty, in
such times, who regarded only one side of the question.’ [It is
Mr. Southey’s fault or his misfortune that at all times he regards
only one side of a question.]</p>

<p class='c010'>‘There is no other misrepresentation. The sentiments of the
historical characters are correctly stated.’ [What, of the King, the
Judge, and the Archbishop?] ‘Were I now to dramatize the same
story, there would be much to add, but little to alter. I should not
express those sentiments less strongly, but I should oppose to them
more enlarged views of the nature of man and the progress of
society. <em>I should set forth with equal force the oppressions of the
feudal system, the excesses of the insurgents, and the treachery of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>government</em>,’ [Doctors doubt that] ‘and hold up the errors and crimes
which were then committed, as a warning <em>for this</em> and for future
generations. I should write <em>as a man; not as a stripling</em>; with the
same heart, and the same desires, but with a ripened understanding
and competent stores of knowledge,’ p. 15. Let him do it, but he
dare not. He would shew by the attempt the hollowness of his
boasted independence, the little time-serving meanness of his most
enlarged views; in a word, that he has still the same understanding,
but no longer the same heart. What are ‘the ripened discoveries
and competent stores of knowledge’ which Mr. Southey would bring
to this task? Are they the barefaced self-evident sophistries, the
wretched shuffling evasions of common-sense and humanity which he
contributes to the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, the cast-off, thread-bare, tattered
excuses of Paley’s Moral Philosophy, and Windham’s hashed-up
speeches? Why, all the prodigious discoveries which Mr. Southey
there details with such dry significance, are familiar to every school-boy,
are the common stock in trade of every spouter at a debating
society, have been bandied about, hackneyed, exhausted any time
these thirty years! And yet Mr. Southey was quite ignorant of
them till very lately; they have broke upon him with a new and
solemn light; they have come upon him by surprise, after three-and-twenty
years; and at the last rebound, have overturned his tottering
patriotism? Where is the use of Mr. Southey’s <em>regular scholastic
education</em>, if he is to be thus ignorant at twenty, thus versatile at forty?
The object of such an education is to make men less astonished at
their own successive discoveries, by putting them in possession before-hand
of what has been discovered by others. Mr. Southey cannot,
like Mr. Cobbett, plead in extenuation of his change of sentiment, that
he was a self-taught man, who had to grope his way from error and
prejudice to truth and reason; neither can he plead like Mr. Cobbett,
in proof of the sincerity of his motives, that he has suffered the loss
of liberty and property by his change of opinion: Mr. Southey has
suffered nothing by his—but a loss of character!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>A Letter to William Smith, Esq.</span> M.P. <em>from</em> Robert Southey, <em>Esq.</em> John Murray, Albemarle-street. 1817. Price 2<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i></h4>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='c021'><em>May 18, 1817.</em></div>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Southey in the next paragraph says, that, ‘it is a nice question,
in what degree he, as the author, partook of the sentiments expressed
in the dramatic poem of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>;—too nice a one for Mr. Wm.
Smith to decide;’ and yet he accuses him of excessive malice or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>total want of judgment for deciding wrong. He then falls foul of
the <cite>Monthly</cite>, and other Dissenting Reviews, for praising his <cite>Joan of
Arc</cite>, and makes it the subject of a sneer at Mr. W. Smith, that his
Minor Poems were praised by the same critical authorities on their
first appearance. We might ask here, Did not Mr. Southey himself
write in these Reviews at one time? But he might refuse to answer
the question. ‘In these productions, <cite>Joan of Arc</cite>,’ &amp;c. Mr. Southey
observes, and observes truly, that Mr. W. Smith ‘might have seen
expressed an enthusiastic love of liberty,’ (not a cold-blooded recommendation
to extinguish the liberty of the press) ‘a detestation of
tyranny in whatever form,’ (legitimate or illegitimate, not a palliation
of all its most inveterate and lasting abuses) ‘an ardent abhorrence
of all wicked ambition,’ (particularly of that most wicked ambition
which would subject mankind, as a herd of cattle, to the power and
pride of Kings) ‘and a sympathy not less ardent with those who
were engaged in war for the defence of their country, and in a
righteous cause’—to wit, the French!</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Southey, however, vindicates with still more self-complacency
and success, the purity of his religious and moral character. ‘For
while I imbibed the Republican opinions of the day, I escaped the
atheism and leprous immorality which generally accompanied them.
I cannot, therefore, join with Beattie in blessing</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——“The hour when I escap’d the wrangling crew,</div>
      <div class='line'>From Pyrrho’s maze, and Epicurus’ sty;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>for I was never lost in the one, nor defiled in the other. My
progress was of a different kind.’ And Mr. Southey then tells a story,
not so good as the story of Whittington and his Cat, how he was
prevented from setting off for America to set up the Pantisocracy
scheme, and turned back, ‘from building castles in the air, and
founding Christian Commonwealths,’ to turn Poet Laureate, and
write in the Quarterly Review. The above extract is a fine specimen
of character. Mr. Southey there thanks God that he is not, and
was not, <em>like other men</em>. He was proof against the worst infection of
his time. Poor Doctors Price and Priestley, who were Republicans
like Mr. Southey, were religious, moral men; but they were
Dissenters, and this excites as much contempt in Mr. Southey, as
if they had been atheists and profligates. Others again, among
Mr. Southey’s political compeers, were atheists and immoral; and
for this, Mr. Southey expresses the same abhorrence of them, as if
they had been Dissenters! He, indeed, contrives to make the
defects of others so many perfections in himself; and by this mode
of proceeding, abstracts himself into a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</span></i> of moral and political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>egotism—a <em>Sir Charles Grandison</em>, calculated for the beginning of the
nineteenth, and the latter end of the eighteenth century, upon the
true infallible principles of intellectual coxcombry. It is well for
Mr. Southey that he never was lost ‘in Pyrrho’s maze,’ for he never
would have found his way out of it:—that his tastes were not a
little more Epicurean, perhaps is not so well for him. There is a
monachism of the understanding in Mr. Southey, which may be
traced to the over-severity, the prudery of his moral habits. He
unites somewhat of the fanaticism and bigotry of the cloister with its
penances and privations. A decent mixture of the pleasurable
and the sensual, might relieve the morbid acrimony of his temper,
and a little more indulgence of his appetites might make him a little
less tenacious of his opinions. It is his not sympathising with the
enjoyments of others, that makes him feel such an antipathy to every
difference of sentiment. We hope Mr. Southey, when he was in
town, went to see <cite>Don Giovanni</cite>, and heard him sing that fine song,
‘Women and wine are the sustainers and glory of life.’ We do not
wish to see Mr. Southey quite a <cite>Don Giovanni</cite>, (that would be as
great a change in his moral, as to see him Poet-laureate, is in his
political character) but if he had fewer pretensions to virtue, he
would, perhaps, be a better man,—‘to relish all as sharply, passioned
as we!’ The author, in p. 21, informs Mr. W. Smith, that his
early Poems, which contain all the political spirit, without the
dramatic form, of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>, are continually on sale, and that he
has never attempted to withdraw them? Why does he not withdraw
them, or why did he attempt to get an Injunction against poor <em>Wat</em>?
Some one who does not know Mr. Southey—has suggested as an
answer,—By not withdrawing the Poems, he pockets the receipts;
and by getting an Injunction against <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>, he would have done
the same thing. In p. 23, Mr. Southey states, that he is ‘in the
same <em>rank in society</em>’ as Mr. Smith, which we have yet to learn: and
that he and Mr. Smith ‘were cast by nature in different moulds,’
which we think was lucky for the Member for Norwich. In p. 25,
Mr. Southey rails at ‘the whole crew of ultra Whigs and Anarchists,
from Messrs. Brougham and Clodius, down to Cobbett, Cethegus
and Co.’; and in pages 26, 27, he compliments himself: ‘I ask
you, Sir, in which of my writings I have appealed to the base and
malignant feelings of mankind;—and I ask you, whether the present
race of revolutionary writers appeal to any other? What man’s
private character did I stab? Whom did I libel? Whom did I
slander? Whom did I traduce? <span class='sc'>These miscreants live by calumny
and sedition: they are libellers and liars by trade.</span>’—After this,
<em>Sir Anthony Absolute’s</em> ‘Damn you, can’t you be cool, like me?’ will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>hardly pass for a joke! ‘For a man to know another well, were to
know himself.’</p>

<p class='c010'>But we must conclude, and shall do so, with some passages taken
at a venture. ‘I did not fall into the error of those, who, having
been the friends of France when they imagined that the cause of
liberty was implicated in her success, transferred their attachment
from the Republic to the military tyranny in which it ended, and
regarded with complacency the progress of oppression, because France
was the oppressor.’ What does Mr. Southey call that military
establishment which is at present kept up in France to keep the
Bourbons on the throne, and to keep down the French people?
Mr. Southey has, it seems, transferred his attachment from the
Republic, not to Bonaparte, but to the Bourbons. <em>They</em> stand
Mr. Southey instead of the Republic; they are the true ‘children
and champions of Jacobinism’; the legitimate heirs and successors
of the Revolution. We have never fallen into that error—into the
error of preferring the monstrous claim of hereditary and perpetual
despotism over whole nations, to a power raised to whatever height,
(a gigantic, but glorious height) in repelling that monstrous claim; a
claim set up in contempt of human nature and human liberty, and
never quitted for a single instant; the unwearied, implacable, systematic
prosecution of which claim, to force the doctrine of Divine Right on
the French people, caused all the calamities of the Revolution, all
the horrors of anarchy, and all the evils of military despotism, with
loss of liberty and independence; and the restoring and hallowing of
which claim, to hold mankind as slaves in perpetuity, Mr. Southey
hails as the deliverance of mankind, and ‘a consummation devoutly to
be wished.’ ‘O fool, fool, fool!’ He cannot go along with France
when France becomes the oppressor; nor can he leave the Allies
when they become the oppressors, when they return to the point
from whence they set out in 1792. He could not accompany the
march to Paris then, but he has run all the way by the side of it
twice since, with his laurel wreath on his head, playing tricks and
antics like a Jack-of-the Green. We explained this before. Mr.
Southey was a revolutionary weathercock; he is become a court-fixture.
‘They (says he, meaning us<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c011'><sup>[37]</sup></a>) had turned their faces
towards the East in the morning, to worship the rising sun, and in
the evening they were looking eastward still, obstinately affirming
that still the sun was there. I, on the contrary, altered my position
as the world went round.’ It is not always that a simile runs on
all-fours; but this does. The sun, indeed, passes from the East to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the West, but it rises in the East again: yet Mr. Southey is still
looking in the West—for his pension. The world has gone round a
second time, but he has not altered his position—at the Treasury
door. Does the sun of Liberty still rise over the towers of the
Inquisition? Is its glow kindled at the funeral pile of massacred
Protestants? Does its breath issue in vain from French dungeons, in
which all those are confined who cannot forget that for twenty-five
years they have been counted men, not slaves to Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span>,
under God and the Prince Regent? The doctrine of Divine Right
has been restored, and Mr. Southey is still dreaming of military
usurpation. The Inquisition has been re-established, and Mr. Southey
still talks of the deliverance of Spain and Portugal. The war was
renewed to put down Bonaparte as a military usurper, and not, as it
was stated, to force the Bourbons as the legitimate Sovereigns, back
upon the French nation; and yet the moment he was put down, the
Bourbons were forced back upon the French people; (he was the only
barrier between them and the delicious doctrine of Divine Right) and
yet Mr. Southey says nothing of this monstrous outrage and insult on
them, on us, on all mankind: his spirits are frozen up by this word
‘legitimacy,’ as fish are in a pond: and yet he does say something—for
he dotes, and raves, and drivels about national monuments to commemorate
the final triumph over national independence and human rights.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Southey next gives us his succedaneum to the doctrine of
Legitimacy; and a precious piece of quackery it is:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Slavery has long ceased to be tolerable in Europe: the remains
of feudal oppression are disappearing even in those countries which
have improved the least: nor can it be much longer endured, that
the extremes of ignorance, wretchedness, and brutality, should exist
in the very centre of civilized society. There can be no safety with
a populace, <em>half Luddite, half Lazzaroni</em>. Let us not deceive
ourselves. We are far from that state in which any thing resembling
equality would be possible; but we are arrived at that state in which
<em>the extremes of inequality</em> are become intolerable. <em>They are too
dangerous, as well as too monstrous, to be borne much longer.</em> Plans
which would have led to the utmost horrors of insurrection, have
been prevented by the government, and by the enactment of strong,
but necessary laws. Let it not, however, be supposed that the
disease is healed, because the ulcer may skin over. The remedies
by which the body politic can be restored to health, must be slow in
their operation. The condition of the populace, physical, moral, and
intellectual, must be improved, or a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jacquerie</span></i>, a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bellum Servile</span></i>, sooner
or later, will be the result. <em>It is the people at this time who stand in
need of reformation, not the government.</em>’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>We could not have said most of this better ourselves; and yet he
adds—‘The Government must better the condition of the populace;
and the first thing necessary is’—to do what—to suppress the liberty
of the press, and make Mr. Southey the keeper. That is, the
Government must put a stop to the press, in order that they may
continue, with perfect impunity, all the other evils complained of,
which Mr. Southey says are too dangerous, as well as too monstrous
to be borne. Put down the liberty of the press, and leave it to
Mr. Southey and the Quarterly Review to remove ‘the extremes of
inequality, ignorance, wretchedness, and brutality, existing in the very
centre of civilized society,’ and they will remain there long enough.
Remove them, and what will become of Mr. Southey and the
Quarterly Review? This modest gentleman and mild reformer,
proposes to destroy at once the freedom of discussion, to prevent its
ultimate loss; to make us free by first making us slaves; to put a
gag in the mouths of the people instead of bread; to increase the
comforts of the poor by laying on more taxes; to spread abroad the
spirit of liberty and independence, by teaching the doctrines of
Passive Obedience and Non-resistance; and to encourage the love
of peace by crying up the benefits of war, and deprecating the loss of
a war-establishment. The borough-mongers will not object to such
a helpmate in the cause of reform. In the midst of all this desultory
jargon, the author somehow scrapes acquaintance with Mr. Owen,
and we find them disputing about the erection of a chapel of ease on
a piece of waste ground. ‘To build upon any other foundation than
religion, is building upon sand,’ says Mr. Southey, with a sort of
<em>Do-me-good</em> air, as if in giving his advice he had performed an act
of charity. We did not hear Mr. Owen’s answer, but we know
that a nod is as good as a wink to that gentleman. Mr. Southey
then talks of the Established Church, whom, as well as the Government,
in his courtly way, he accuses of having for centuries ‘neglected
its first and paramount duty,’ the bettering the condition of the
people; of Saving Banks; of colonies of disbanded soldiers and
sailors; of columns of Waterloo and Trafalgar; of diminishing the
poor-rates, and improving the morals of the people, so that they may
live without eating; of the glories of our war-expenditure, and of the
necessity of keeping up the same expenditure in time of peace.
‘Never indeed,’ he exclaims, ‘was there a more senseless cry than
that which is at this time raised for retrenchment in the public
expenditure, as a means of alleviating the present distress.’ [This
senseless cry, however, is either an echo of, or was echoed by, the
Prince Regent in his Speech from the Throne. Is there no better
understanding between Mr. Southey and the Prince Regent’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>advisers?]—‘That distress arises from a great and sudden diminution
of employment, occasioned by many coinciding causes, the chief
of which is, that the war-expenditure of from forty to fifty millions
yearly, has ceased.’—[No, the chief is, that our war-expenses of
from forty to fifty millions yearly and for ever, are continued, and
that our war-monopoly of trade to pay them with has ceased.]—‘Men
are out of employ’—[True.]... ‘the evil is, that too
little is spent,’ [Because we have wasted too much.]—‘and as a
remedy, we are exhorted to spend less.’ [‘Yes, to waste less, or to
spend what we have left in things useful to ourselves, and not in
Government gimcracks, whether of peace or war.’] Is it better, does
Mr. Southey think, that ten poor men should keep ten pounds a-piece
in their pockets, which they would of course spend in food, clothing,
fuel, &amp;c. for themselves and families, or that this hundred pounds,
that is, ten pounds a-piece, should be paid out of the pockets of these
ten poor men in <em>taxes</em>, which, added to Mr. Croker’s salary, would
enable him to keep another horse, to pay for the feed, furniture,
saddle, bridle, whip, and spurs? We ask Mr. Southey this question,
and will put the issue of the whole argument upon the answer to it.
The money would be spent equally in either case, say in agriculture,
in raising corn for instance, wheat or oats: but the corn raised and
paid for by it in the one instance would go into the belly of the poor
man and his family: in the other, into the belly of Mr. Croker’s
horse. Does that make no difference to Mr. Southey? Answer,
Man of Humanity! Or, if Mr. Southey, the Man of Humanity,
will not answer, let Mr. Malthus, the Man of God, answer for him!
Again, what would go to pay for a new saddle for the Secretary of
the Admiralty, would buy the poor man and his family so many pair
of shoes in the year; or what would pay for a straw litter for his
sleek gelding, would stuff a flock-bed for the poor man’s children!
Does not Mr. Southey understand this question yet? We have
given him a clue to the whole difference between productive and
unproductive labour, between waste and economy, between taxes and
no taxes, between a war-expenditure and what ought to be a peace-establishment,
between money laid out and debts contracted in
gunpowder, in cannon, in ships of war, in scattering death, and
money laid out in paying for food, furniture, houses, the comforts,
necessaries, and enjoyments of life. Let Mr. Southey take the
problem and the solution with him to Italy, study it there amidst a
population, half Lazzaroni, half Monks:<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c011'><sup>[38]</sup></a> let him see his error, and
return an honest man! But if he will not believe us, let him at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>believe himself. In the career of his triumph about our national
monuments, he has fallen into one of the most memorable lapses of
memory we ever met with. ‘In proportion,’ says he, ‘to their magnificence,
also, will be the present benefit, as well as the future good;
for they are not like the Egyptian pyramids, to be raised by bondsmen
under rigorous taskmasters: the wealth which is taken from the
people returns to them again, like vapours which are drawn imperceptibly
from the earth, but distributed to it in refreshing dews<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c011'><sup>[39]</sup></a> and
fertilizing showers. What bounds could imagination set to the
welfare and glory of this island, if a tenth part, or even a twentieth
of what the war expenditure has been, were annually applied in
improving and creating harbours, in bringing our roads to the best
possible state, in colonizing upon our waste lands, in reclaiming fens
and conquering tracks from the sea, in encouraging the liberal arts, in
erecting churches, in building and endowing schools and colleges, and
making war upon physical and moral evil with the whole artillery of
wisdom and righteousness, with all the resources of science, and all
the ardour of enlightened and enlarged benevolence!’</p>

<p class='c010'>Well done, Mr. Southey. No man can argue better, when he
argues against himself. What! one-twentieth part of this enormous
waste of money laid out in war, which has sunk the nation into the
lowest state of wretchedness, would, if wisely and beneficially laid
out in works of peace, have raised the country to the pinnacle of
prosperity and happiness! Mr. Southey in his raptures forgets his
war-whoop, and is ready to exclaim with <em>Sancho Panza</em>, when the
exploits of knight-errantry are over, and he turns all his enthusiasm to
a pastoral account, ‘Oh what delicate wooden spoons shall I carve!
What crumbs and cream shall I devour!’ Mr. Southey goes on to
state, among other <em>items</em>, that ‘Government should reform its prisons.’
But Lord Castlereagh, soon after the war-addition to Mr. Croker’s
peace-salary, said that this was too expensive. In short, the author
sums up all his hopes and views in the following sentences:—‘Government
must reform the populace, the people must reform
themselves.’ The interpretation of which is, The Government must
prevent the lower classes from reading any thing; the middle classes
should read nothing but the Quarterly Review. ‘This is the true
Reform, and compared with this, all else is, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">flocci, nauci, nihili, pili</span></i>.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The last page of this performance is ‘as arrogant a piece of paper’
as was ever scribbled. We give it as it stands. ‘It will be said of
him, (Mr. S.) that in an age of personality, he abstained from satire;
and that during the course of his literary life, often as he was assailed,
the only occasion on which he ever <em>condescended</em> to reply, was, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span><em>a certain Mr. William Smith</em>’—[What, was the only person worthy
of Mr. Southey’s notice a very insignificant person?] ‘insulted him in
Parliament with the appellation of Renegade. On that occasion, it
will be said, that he vindicated himself, <em>as it became him to do</em>: [How
so? Mr. Southey is only a literary man, and neither a commoner
nor a peer of the realm] ‘and treated his calumniator <em>with just and
memorable severity</em>. Whether it shall be added, that Mr. William
Smith redeemed his own character, by coming forward with honest
manliness, and acknowledging that he had spoken rashly and unjustly,
concerns himself, but is not of the slightest importance to me.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Robert Southey.</span>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>We do not think this conclusion is very like what Mr. Southey
somewhere wishes the conclusion of his life to resemble—‘the high
leaves upon the holly tree.’ Mr. Southey’s asperities do not wear off,
as he grows older. We are always disposed to quarrel with ourselves
for quarrelling with him, and yet we cannot help it, whenever we
come in contact with his writings. We met him unexpectedly the
other day in St. Giles’s, (it was odd we should meet <em>him</em> there) were
sorry we had passed him without speaking to an old friend, turned
and looked after him for some time, as to a tale of other times—sighing,
as we walked on, <em>Alas poor Southey!</em> ‘We saw in him a
painful hieroglyphic of humanity; a sad memento of departed independence;
a striking instance of the rise and fall of patriot bards!’
In the humour we were in, we could have written a better epitaph,
for him than he has done for himself. We went directly and bought
his Letter to Mr. W. Smith, which appeared the same day as himself,
and this at once put an end to our sentimentality.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lord Castlereagh, in the debate some evenings ago, appeared in
a new character, and mingled with his usual stock of political common
places, some lively moral paradoxes, after a new French pattern.
According to his Lordship’s comprehensive and liberal views, the
liberty and independence of nations are best supported abroad by the
point of the bayonet; and morality, religion, and social order, are
best defended at home by spies and informers. It is a pretty system,
and worthy of itself from first to last. The Noble Lord in the blue
ribbon took the characters of Castles and Oliver under the protection
of his blushing honours and elegant casuistry, and lamented that by
the idle clamour raised against such characters, <em>Gentlemen</em> were
deterred from entering into the honourable, useful, and profitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>profession of Government Spies. Perhaps this piece of intellectual
gallantry on the part of the Noble Lord, was not quite so disinterested
as it at first appears. There might be something of fellow-feeling
in it. The obloquy which lights on the underlings in such cases,
sometimes glances indirectly on their principals and patrons; nor do
they wipe it off by becoming their defenders. Lord Castlereagh
may say with <em>Lingo</em> in the play, who boasts ‘that he is not a scholar,
but a master of scholars,’ that he is not a spy, but a creator of spies
and informers—not a receiver, but a distributor of blood-money—not
a travelling companion and scurvy accomplice in the forging and
uttering of sham treasons and accommodation plots, but head of the
town-firm established for that purpose—not the dupe or agent of the
treason hatched by others, but chief mover and instigator of the grand
plot for increasing the power of the Sovereign, by hazarding the
safety of his person. Lord Castlereagh recommended the character
of his accomplices, as spies and informers, to the respect and gratitude
of the country and the House; he lamented the prejudice entertained
against this species of patriotic service, as hindering <em>gentlemen</em> from
resorting to it as a liberal and honourable profession. One of these
delicious protegés of ministerial gratitude, was, it seems, at one time
a distributor of forged notes, and gained the reward promised by Act
of Parliament, by hanging his accomplices. Could not his Lordship’s
nice notions of honour relax a little farther, and recommend the legal
traffic in bank notes and blood-money, as a new opening to honourable
ambition and profitable industry? Castles’s wife was also the keeper
of a house of ill fame. Could not his Lordship, with the hand of
a master, have drawn a veil of delicacy over this slight stain in his
character, and redeemed a profession, not without high example to
justify it, from the vulgar obloquy that attends it? We are afraid
his Lordship is but half an adept in these sort of lax paradoxes, and
that Peachum, Jonathan Wild, and Count Fathom, are much honester
teachers of that kind of transcendental morality than he. This kind
of revolutionary jargon must have sounded oddly in the ears of some
of his Lordship’s hearers. Mr. Wynne, who dreads all re-action so
much, must have looked particularly argute at this innovation in the
parliamentary theory of moral sentiments. What would the country
gentlemen say to it? One would think Lord Lascelles’s hat, that
broad brimmed monument of true old English respectability, must
have cowered and doubled down in dog’s ears at the sound! What
will the ardent and superannuated zeal of that <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">preux Chevalier</span></i>, the
Editor of <cite>The Day and New Times</cite>, say to this stain upon the innate
honour and purity of legitimacy, to this new proof that ‘the age of
chivalry is gone for ever, and that of sophisters, economists, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>calculators, has succeeded!’ What will John Bull, who has been
crammed these twenty-five years with the draff and husks of concrete
prejudices, unsifted, unbolted, in their rawest state, say to the
analytical distinctions, to the refined <em>police</em>-morality of the Noble
Lord? We might consider his harangue on the public services and
private virtues of spies and informers, according to the utility-doctrine
of modern philosophy, as forming an era in the history of English
loyalty and Parliamentary pliability. What! Is it meant, after
building up the present system of power and influence on the
accumulated pile of our political prejudices, to extend and strengthen
it, by undermining all our moral sentiments and national habits? Yet
we are told, that there is no imputation on the <em>moral</em> character of
Oliver! We wonder Mr. Wilberforce did not suggest that his
<em>religious</em> character also remained unimpeached, except, indeed, that
he had been guilty of subornation of treason on the Sabbath-day.
According to our present catechism of legitimacy, to be a <em>cat’s-paw</em>
is to be virtuous—is to be moral—is to be pious—is to be loyal—is
to be a patriot—is to be what Castles <em>is</em>, and Castlereagh <em>approves</em>!—This
subject naturally leads us into low company and low allusions.
As, after Fielding’s Hero had finished his speech on <em>honour</em> his
friend the <em>Count</em> pronounced him a Great Prig, so, after Lord
Castlereagh’s speech of Monday evening, we can no longer refuse
to consider him a Great Man, in the sense of the philosophical
historian; that is to say, a man who has a very great regard for
himself, and a very great contempt for the prejudices and feelings
of the rest of mankind.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>ON THE SPY-SYSTEM (<em>continued</em>)</h3>

<div class='lg-container-r c002'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>July 15, 1817.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The debate in the House of Commons on Mr. Brougham’s motion
took a very spirited, and rather personal turn. We do not think
Lord Castlereagh was quite successful in rebutting the principal
charges brought against his foreign and domestic policy. With
respect to Genoa, for instance, and the late arbitrary contributions
levied on British merchants there, his Lordship seemed to say that
he had but one object, and that in this respect his conduct had been
uniformly consistent while abroad, namely, to protect legitimacy, and
that the rights and property of British subjects were accordingly left
to shift for themselves, as things beneath his notice. This answer
will hardly satisfy most of our readers. He considered it an illiberal
and injurious policy to attempt to force our exclusive commercial
interests upon foreign nations. But is there no alternative in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Lordship’s mind between bullying and domineering over other
nations, and tamely crouching under every species of insult or act
of pillage they may wantonly exercise upon us? We have put
down the colossal power of Bonaparte. Is every ‘petty tyrant’
who has succeeded him, to brave us with impunity, lest a word of
remonstrance, a whisper of complaint, should rouse their vengeance?
Are we not to mention their names, lest these new Gods of the
earth, these modern <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dii Minores</span></i>, should hear us! His Lordship
also appears to despair of the restoration of peace in Spanish
America. If he includes in the idea of <em>peace</em> the quiet re-establishment
of the tyranny of the old Government, we are happy
to agree with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>With respect to the changes which have taken place at home, his
Lordship failed in making the necessity for them clear to our understandings.
We cannot assent to the accuracy of his statements, or
the soundness of his logic. He has suspended the laws of the country
to save us from the danger of anarchy! We deny the danger, and
deprecate the remedy. If ministers could afford to fan the flame of
insurrection, to <em>alarm</em> the country into a surrender of its liberties, we
contend that a danger that could be thus tampered with, thus made a
convenient pretence for seizing a power beyond the law to put it down,
might have been put down <em>without a power beyond the law</em>. If a
Government’s conspiring against itself were a sufficient ground for
arming it with arbitrary power, no country could for a moment be
safe against ministerial treachery and encroachment, against real
despotism founded on pretended disaffection. Government would be
in perpetual convulsions and affected hysterics, like a fine lady who
wants to domineer over her credulous husband. We deny that
disaffection existed, except that kind which arose from extreme
distress. Hunger is not disloyalty. Nor can we admit that a
Government’s having reduced a country to a state of unparalleled
distress, and consequent desperation, is a reason for giving <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte-blanche</span></i>
to the Government, and putting the people under military
execution. At this rate, the worse the Government, the more
firmly it ought to be rooted: the greater the abuse of confidence,
the more blind and unlimited the confidence ought to be: and any
administration need only bring a nation to the brink of ruin, in
order to have a right to plunge it into the depths of slavery. It is
easy to keep the peace with the sword;—more flattering to the pride
of power to crush resistance to oppression, than to remove the causes
of it. To reduce a people to the alternative of rebellion or of
arbitrary sway, does not require the talents of a great statesman. If
Lord Castlereagh claims the merit of having reduced us to that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>alternative, we shall not dispute it with him: whatever may be the
result, we cannot thank him.</p>

<p class='c010'>His Lordship might, however, have made good his retreat, with a
decent orderly appearance, if he had not chosen to go out of his way
to take up a Spy behind him on his new metaphysical charger, and to
ride the high horse over all those, who are not the fast friends and
staunch admirers of that profession, as traitors and <em>no true men</em>. Sir
Francis Burdett, not relishing this assault of the master and man,
pulled off the Squire, and rolling him in the mud, pelted him so
unmercifully with Irish evidence and musty affidavits of his friends
and relations, that his gallant patron, seeing the plight he was in, dismounted,
and was condescending enough to acknowledge, that ‘cruelty
was in every species detestable,’ and that ‘he lamented to think that
there were miscreants in human nature capable of committing crime
for the love of reward’; sentiments not new indeed, but new in his
Lordship’s mouth. The country gentlemen must have felt relieved,
and Lord Lascelles’s hat have recovered its primitive shape! The
House of Commons is no dupe; Lord Castlereagh no driveller.
Would he then seriously persuade them, that the Spy hanged his old
friends and accomplices out of pure love to his country, and disinterested
friendship to his Lordship? We would advise the noble
Lord in the blue ribbon to <em>cut</em> his parliamentary connexion with his
police acquaintance at once. The thing cannot answer; it is against
decorum. He might as well introduce his scavenger as a person of
fashion at Carlton-House, as attempt to pass off his <em>Spy</em> as a gentleman,
and a man of honour, any where else! The gentlemen-ushers would
turn up their noses at one of his Lordship’s necessary appendages,
and the moral sense of the English nation turns with disgust from the
other, when forced upon it as a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau morceau</span></i> of morality, with the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauce picquant</span></i> of ministerial panegyric! We were glad to find the
former Secretary for Ireland reprobating the practice of flogging to
extract evidence, as ‘a most wicked and unwarrantable piece of
torture’; a confession which seemed to be extorted from his Lordship
by the impression made by the reading of some of Mr. Finnerty’s
affidavits, as they are called, though they are no more Mr. Finnerty’s
affidavits, who procured them, than they are Mr. Bennet’s, who read
them. Every thing relating to this subject is particularly interesting
at this moment, when the same power is vested in the same hands in
this country, that was wielded twenty years ago in Ireland—not
indeed as a precedent to the English government, but as a warning
to the English people. We give no opinion on the truth or falsehood
of the allegations contained in the affidavits, but we do say, that
the noble Secretary reasoned very badly on the subject. He says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>that Mr. Finnerty is not a very loyal man, that is, he is not very
strongly attached to his Lordship’s person or government, and therefore
neither Mr. Finnerty, nor any person taking an oath in an Irish
court of justice, reflecting on his Lordship’s administration, is to be
believed. Mr. Finnerty published an account of the proceedings on
Orr’s trial, which was deemed a libel, and therefore the whole
history of the Irish rebellion and of the year 1798 is a fable. Lord
Castlereagh would not consent to quash his prosecution of Mr.
Finnerty on this ground some years ago, because he would not shun
inquiry, and yet the affidavits were not suffered to be read in court,
and his lordship deprecates their production in parliament. He
thinks it hard that he must be called on to prove a negative, when
others swear positively to the affirmative. Accusation against his
Lordship is to pass not for a proof of guilt but innocence, and his
inability to refute the charge only calls for a greater degree of candid
interpretation and implicit faith in his Lordship’s word. Insinuation
only requires confidence to repel it—proof more confidence—conviction
unlimited confidence. Whether the things ever happened or
no, they are to be equally buried in eternal silence in Mr. Finnerty’s
‘disloyal breast’: not a tittle of evidence is to be suffered to escape
from the budget of affidavits which he has got together by forbidden
means. His Lordship’s Irish administration is to be
inscrutable as another Providence, secret as another Inquisition;
the English Parliament are to put the broad seal of their sanction
upon it! It was certainly unlucky at this juncture of the debate,
that Mr. W. Smith should have started up with the case of Mr.
Judkin Fitzgerald, who (it seems, by his own account of his services,
not from any affidavits against him) had been most active in inflicting
this ‘cruel and unwarrantable species of torture,’ and was made a
Baronet in consequence.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And struts Sir Judkin, an exceeding knave!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The unconsciousness of the Irish government exceeds every thing.
They are not only ‘innocent of the knowledge, till they applaud the
deed,’ but ignorant of it, after they have applauded it. It is no
wonder that the fixed air and volatile spirit of Mr. Canning’s wit
frothed up at this indiscreet mention of Sir Judkin, and that he
wished to ‘bury him quick,’ under the artificial flowers of his oratory.
<em>The dead tell no tales</em>—of the dead or the living! Mr. Canning
twitted Mr. W. Smith with attacking the dead, because ‘he had
found that the absent could answer.’ Does this allude to the
Laureate? If so, let Mr. Canning call for more flowers, and lay
him by the side of Sir Judkin. This allusion to the answer to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Mr. W. Smith is, however, remarkably candid, as Mr. Southey
declares in it that he never thought Mr. Canning worth an answer.
He may now return the compliment in kind, by inscribing the next
edition of his ‘Inscriptions’ to the author of the ‘Anti-Jacobin.’</p>

<p class='c013'>A writer in a Morning Paper, a few days ago, commented very
wisely and wittily on the situation of the State Prisoners under the Suspension
of the Habeas Corpus, as a warning to the people of England
not to meddle in politics. He seemed infinitely amused with the
inability of these poor devils ‘to get out,’ though he seemed to know
no reason why they should be kept in. ‘One of these gentlemen
must have a flute, <em>forsooth</em>!’ he exclaims with a very hysterical air,
as if it was a good joke truly for a man to have a flute taken from
him, and not to be able to get it back again.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c011'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Even Mr. Hiley
Addington allows that Evans might have his flute again, if he did
not use it. If this writer had himself been in the habit of blowing
a great war-trumpet, and wished to make as much noise as ever with
it in time of peace, he might not like to have it taken from him.
He, however, consoles Mr. Evans for the loss of his flute, with the
very old and original observation, ‘That the people bear the same
relation to the Government, as the sheep to the shepherd, and that the
sheep ought not to dictate to the shepherd, or remonstrate against what
he does for their good.’ Now the sheep are not usually in the habit
of dictating, or remonstrating on such occasions, except in that sort
of language which <em>Lawyer Scout</em> advises <em>Sheep-face</em> to imitate before
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Justice Mittimus</span></i>, and to which this Professional Gentleman seems to
wish the State Prisoners to resort in their intercourse with the Home
Department. The fleecy fools, whom the writer holds up as models
of wisdom and spirit to his countrymen, do, to be sure, make a
terrible noise at a sheep-shearing, and a short struggle when they feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>the knife at their throats. But our allegorist, we suspect, would regard
these as Jacobinical, or Ultra-Jacobinical symptoms. He would have
the people stand still to be fleeced, and have their throats cut, whenever
Government pleases. He has in his eye the sublimest example
of self-devotion: ‘As a lamb, he was led to the slaughter: as a sheep
before the shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.’ We
cannot understand the point of comparison in this <em>sheep-biting</em> argument.
If the people are really to be as silly, and as submissive as sheep, they
will be worse treated. A flock of sheep pass their time very comfortably
on Salisbury plain, biting the short sweet grass, or lying with
‘meek mouths ruminant,’ till they are fit to send to market: we have
sometimes heard them fill the air with a troublous cry, as they pass
down Oxford-street, to Smithfield, and the next morning it is all
over with them. But Governments have not the same reasons for
taking care of the people, ‘poor, poor dumb mouths,’ they do not
ordinarily sell them or eat them. The comparison would be much
nearer to beasts of burden, asses, or ‘camels in their war,’ who, as
Shakspeare expresses it,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>——‘have their provender</div>

      <div class='line'>For sinking under them.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>However edifying and attractive these kind of examples of simplicity,
patience, and good behaviour, taken from sheep, oxen, and asses,
must be to the people, they are rather invidious, something worse
than equivocal, as they relate to the designs and good-will of the
Government towards them. This writer indeed commits himself
very strangely on this subject, or, as the phrase is, <em>lets the cat out of
the bag</em>, without intending it. In a broadside which he published
against the author of the ‘Political Register,’ he says with infinite
<em>naiveté</em>:—‘Mr. Cobbett had been sentenced to two years’ imprisonment
for a libel; and during the time that he was in Newgate, it was
discovered that he had been secretly in treaty with Government to
avoid the sentence passed upon him; and that he had proposed
to certain of the Agents of Ministers, that if they would let him
off, they might make what future use they pleased of him: <em>he would
entirely betray the cause of the people</em>: he would either write or not
write, or <em>write against them</em>, as he had once done before, just as
Ministers thought proper. To this, however, it was replied, that
“<em>Cobbett had written on too many sides already to be worth a groat
for the service of Government,” and he accordingly suffered his
confinement</em>.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>This passage is at least worth a groat: it lets us into the Editor’s
real opinion of what it is that alone makes any writer ‘worth a
groat for the service of Government,’ viz. his being able and willing
<em>entirely to betray the cause of the people</em>; and, we should hope,
may operate as an antidote to any future cant about sheep and
shepherds!</p>

<p class='c010'>The same consistent patriot and loyalist, the Sir Robert Filmer of
the day, asked some time ago—‘Where is the madman that believes
the doctrine of Divine Right? Where is the madman that asserts
that doctrine?’ As no one else was found to do it, he himself, the
other day, took up his own challenge, and affirmed, with a resolute
air, that—‘Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span> had the same right to the throne of France,
independently of his merits or conduct, that Mr. Coke, of Norfolk,
had to his estate at Holkham.’ He did not say whether James <span class='fss'>II.</span>
had the same right to the throne of England, independently of his
conduct or merits, that Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span> has to the throne of France:
but the inference of course is that the people of France belong to
Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span> just as the live stock on a farm belongs to the owner of
it, or as the slaves in the West Indies belong to the owners of the
plantation, and that mankind are neither more or less than a herd of
slaves, the property of kings. This is at least as good a thing as
the doctrine of divine right. We do not wonder that the writer,
after this ‘delicious declaration,’ thought it proper to apologize to his
court-readers for expressing his approbation of the abolition of the
Slave Trade, as indirectly compromising those principles of legitimacy,
which make one part of the species the property of another, and
which we have seen so successfully established in Europe as the basis
of liberty, humanity, and social order!</p>

<cite>The Courier</cite>! They attack Sir Judkin Fitzgerald and the use of
the torture; and <em>therefore</em> they attack all that is valuable in our
institutions. They attack the system of spies and informers; and
therefore they attack all that is valuable in our institutions. They
object to the moral characters of such men as Castles and Oliver;
and therefore they attack all that is most respectable in the country.
They consider Lord Sidmouth, who is ‘to acquaint us with the
perfect spy o’ th’ time,’ as no conjurer, treat his circular letters and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>itinerant incendiaries with as little ceremony as respect; and therefore
they are hostile to all that is venerable in our constituted authorities.
They do not approve of the Suspension of the Habeas Corpus, of
Standing Armies, and Rotten Boroughs; and therefore they would
overturn all that is most valuable in the Constitution. They say that
Lord Castlereagh was connected with the measures of the Irish
government in the year 1798; and they are said to hold a language
‘grossly libellous.’ They say that they do not wish the same system
to be introduced by his Lordship in this country; and their principles
are denounced as ‘of a decidedly revolutionary character.’ They
think of the present administration as Mr. Canning formerly thought
of it, and they think of Mr. Canning as all the world think. Is that
all? Oh no! They speak against the renewal of the Income Tax;
and this, in the opinion of some persons, is attacking what is more
valuable than all our other institutions put together! For our own
parts, our political confession of faith on this subject is short: we
neither consider Lord Castlereagh as the Constitution, nor <cite>The Courier</cite>
as the Country.</p>

<p class='c010'>But if, after all, and in spite of our teeth, we should be forced to
acknowledge that Sir Judkin Fitzgerald and the use of the torture,
that the system of spies and informers, that Lord Sidmouth’s sagacity,
circulars, and travelling delegates, that arbitrary imprisonment and
solitary confinement, the Suspension of the Habeas Corpus, Standing
Armies, and Rotten Boroughs, Lord Castlereagh’s past measures or
future designs, Mr. Canning’s love of liberty, and Mr. Vansittart’s
hankerings after the Income Tax, are all that is left <em>valuable in our
institutions, or respectable in the country</em>, then we must say, that the
more effectually the Opposition ‘attack all that is valuable in such
institutions,’ the more we shall thank them; and that the sooner we
can get rid of all that is ‘most respectable’ in such a system, the less
occasion we shall have to blush for the Country.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c021'><em>August 13, 1817.</em></div>

<p class='c010'>The whole question of the effect of war and taxes, in an economical
point of view, reduces itself to the distinction between <em>productive</em> and
<em>unproductive labour</em>. It is a pity that some member of the House
of Commons does not move a string of resolutions on this subject,
as a comment on the measures of the present, and a guide to those
of future reigns. A film appears to have been spread for some time
over the eyes of the nation, as to the consequences of the course
they were pursuing; and a good deal of pains has been taken, by
sophistry, and false statements, to perplex a very plain question. But
we are not without hopes, in the following observations, of putting
the merits of our debt and taxes in so clear a light, that not even the
Finance Committee shall be any longer blind to them.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Labour is of two kinds, productive and unproductive:—that which
adds materially to the comforts and necessaries of life, or that which
adds nothing to the common stock, or nothing in proportion to what
it takes away from it in order to maintain itself. Money may be laid
out, and people employed in either of these two kinds of labour
equally, but not, we imagine, with equal benefit to the community.—[<em>See
p. <a href='#Page_130'>130</a>, &amp;c. of this volume.</em>]</p>

<p class='c010'>Suppose I employ a man in standing on his head, or running up
and down a hill all day, and that I give him five shillings a day for
his pains. He is equally employed, equally paid, and equally gains
a subsistence in this way, as if he was employed, in his original trade
of a shoemaker, in making a pair of shoes for a person who wants
them. But in the one case he is employed in unproductive, in the
other in productive labour. In the one, he is employed and paid
and receives a subsistence for doing that which might as well be let
alone; in the other, for doing that which is of use and importance,
and which must either be done by him, or give some one else double
trouble to do it. If I hire a livery-servant, and keep him fine and lazy
and well-fed to stand behind my chair while I eat turtle or venison,
this is another instance of unproductive labour. Now the person
who is in real want of a pair of shoes, and who has by his own labour
and skill raised money enough to pay for them will not assuredly
lay it out, in preference, in hiring the shoemaker to run up a hill for
him, or to stand upon his head, or behind a chair for his amusement.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c011'><sup>[42]</sup></a>
But if I have received this money from him in the shape
of taxes, having already received enough in the same way to pay
for my shoes, my stockings, my house, my furniture, &amp;c., then
it is very likely (as we see it constantly happen) that I shall lay
out this last five shillings worth of taxes, which I probably get
for doing nothing, in employing another person to do nothing,—or
to run up a hill, or to stand upon his head, or wait behind me
at dinner, while the poor man, who pays me the tax, goes without
his shoes and his dinner. Is this clear? Or put it thus in two
words. <em>That</em> is productive labour, for which a man will give the
only money he has in the world, or a certain sum, having no more
than other people: <em>that</em> is unproductive labour, for which a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>will never give the only money he is worth, the money he has earned
by his own labour, nor any money at all, unless he has ten times as
much as he wants, or as other people have, to throw away in
superfluities. A man who has only got money to buy a loaf will not lay
it out in an ice. But he may lay it out in a dram? Yes; because to
the wretched it is often more important to forget their future than even
to supply their present wants. The extravagance and thoughtlessness
of the poor arise, not from their having more than enough to
satisfy their immediate necessities, but from their not having enough
to ward off impending ones,—in a word, from <em>desperation</em>. This
is the true answer to Mr. Malthus’s politico-theological system
of parish ethics, the only real clue to the causes and the cure of
pauperism!</p>

<p class='c010'>If the Board of Works were to have a canal made from London
to the Land’s End (as has been proposed) this, for aught we know,
would be productive labour, and well paid for out of the public
taxes; because the public might in the end reap the benefit of the
money and the labour so employed. But if the Prince Regent were
by the advice of some fantastical, purblind politician, to order this
canal to be lined all the way with gold-leaf, which would be washed
away as soon as the water came into the canal, this is what we should
call unproductive labour. Such a project would indeed cost as much
money, it would require the raising of as many taxes, it would keep
as many men employed, it would maintain them while they were so
employed, just as well as if they were employed in any other way;
but when done, it would be of no use to Prince or people. We have
heard of a patriotic nobleman, who had a brick-wall built round his
estate, to give employment to the poor in his neighbourhood. If he
had afterwards employed them to pull it down again, it would have
given them twice the employment and done twice the good. But
if the same persons had been employed in productive labour, in
raising corn, in making furniture, in building or improving cottages,
it would not have been equally adviseable to set them to work again
to burn the corn, or destroy the furniture, or pull down the
cottages. In spite then of the fashionable doctrines of political
economy, so well suited to the extravagance of the times, there is
something else to be considered in judging of the value of labour,
besides what it costs, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>, what it <em>produces</em>; whether it is of use to
any body, and to whom. All is not gain that goes out of the purse.
The nobleman above mentioned did not take the money to pay for
building the wall round his estate out of the pockets of the people;
but suppose an equal sum to be taken yearly out of the Civil List or
any other branch of public revenue, and employed in raising some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>huge heap of stones—not a monument, but a mausoleum of royal
taste and magnificence—the question is, whether the money thus
raised by taxes, and laid out in a job, is a saving or a loss to the
public? And this question is, we conceive, answered by another,
whether if the money had remained in the hands of the public, they
would have agreed among themselves, to have laid it out in such a
building for them to look at? It would hardly be thought wise to
vote a sum of money, to build a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cottage Ornée</span></i>, large enough to cover a
whole county; though the expense (and, according to the theory we
are combating, the benefit) would increase with the size of the building
and the waste of work. The Pyramids of Egypt and the
Pavilion at Brighton, are among the instances of unproductive
labour.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have been twenty years at war, and have laid out five hundred
millions in war taxes; and what have we gained by it? Where are
the <em>proceeds</em>? If it has not been thrown away in what produces no
return, if it has not been sunk in the war, as much as if it had been
sunk in the sea, if the government as good factors for the general
weal have laid out all this enormous sum in useful works, in <em>productive
labour</em>, let them give us back the principal and the interest,
(which is just double) and keep the profits to themselves—instead of
which, they have made away with the principal, and come to us to
pay <em>them</em> the interest in taxes. They have nothing to shew for either,
but spiked cannon, rotten ships, gunpowder blown into the air,
heaps of dead men’s skulls, the turned heads and coats of Poets
Laureate, with the glories of Trafalgar and Waterloo, which however
will pay no scores. Let them set them up at auction, and see
what they will fetch. Not a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sous</span></i>! We have killed so many
French, it is true. But we had better have spent powder and shot
in shooting at crows. Though we have laid the ghost of the French
Revolution, we cannot ‘go to supper’ upon the carcase. If the
present distress and difficulty arise merely from our no longer having
a bugbear to contend with, or because (as Mr. Southey says), the
war is no longer a customer to the markets, to the amount of fifty
millions a year, why not declare war upon the Man in the Moon to-morrow,
and never leave off till we have sent him to keep Bonaparte
company at St. Helena? Why, it is but ordering so many cannon
and cutlasses, no matter for what purpose—and equipping, and
fantastically accoutring so many loyal corps of <em>minions of the
moon</em>, <em>Diana’s foresters</em>, and ‘the manufactures of Birmingham
and Sheffield would revive to-morrow.’ If we had howitzers
before of a prodigious size, let us have bombs of a calibre that Lord
Castlereagh never dreamt of; and instead of iron balls, golden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>ones. Why not? The expense would be the greater. If we
made the earth ring before, let us now make the welkin roar.
The absurdity would be as costly, and more bloodless. A
voyage to the moon would take at least as much time, as many lives
and millions to accomplish as the march to Paris. But then our
merchants would not meanwhile get a monopoly of the trade of
Europe, to stimulate their laggard patriotism, nor would the
sovereigns of Europe be able to plant the standard of Legitimacy
on the horns of the moon!—But though we have nothing to shew
for the money we have madly squandered in war, we have something
to pay for it (rather more than we can afford) to contractors,
monopolists, and sinecurists, to the great fundholders and borough-mongers,
to those who have helped to carry on, and to those
who have been paid for applauding this sport-royal, as the most
patriotic and profitable employment of the wealth and resources
of a country. These persons, the tax-receivers, have got a
mortgage on the property, health, strength, and skill of the rest
of the community, who pay the taxes, which bows their industry
to the ground, and deprives them of the necessary means of subsistence.
The principal of the debt which the nation has contracted, has been
laid out in <em>unproductive labour</em>, in inflicting the mischiefs and miseries
of war; and the interest is for the most part equally laid out in
<em>unproductive labour</em>, in fomenting the pride and luxury of those who
have made their fortunes by the war and taxes. In a word, the debt
and taxes are a government machine, which diverts that portion of the
wealth and industry of the people, which would otherwise be employed
in supplying the wants and comforts (say) of a hundred persons, to
pamper the extravagance, vices, and artificial appetites of a single
individual; and so on in proportion to the whole country. Every
tax laid on in this manner, unnerves the arm of industry, is wrung from
the bowels of want, and breaks the spirit of a nation, lessens the
number of hands which are employed in useful labour, to seduce them
into artificial, dependent, and precarious modes of subsistence, while
the rich themselves find their reward for the indulgence of their
indolence and voluptuousness in ‘the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,’
so that ‘their proper loins do curse them.’ It has been said that the
taxes taken from the people return to them again, like the vapours
drawn up from the earth in clouds, that descend again in refreshing
dews and fertilizing showers. On the contrary, they are like these
dews and showers drawn off from the ground by artificial channels
into private reservoirs and useless cisterns to stagnate and corrupt.
The money which is paid in taxes is taken from the people; the
labour for which it pays does not benefit the people. A tax which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>goes to pay for the feeding of a pair of curricle horses or favourite
hunters, swallows up the subsistence of several poor families. We
cannot for ourselves approve of the privations, of the hunger, cold, or
nakedness, to which these poor families are exposed, to keep up the
flesh and the spirit of the sleek and high-mettled inhabitants of the
warm, well-littered stable, even though they were of the breed of
Swift’s Houynhyms! But that is a different question. All that we
mean to say here is, that the tax takes the corn out of the bellies of
the one to put it into those of the other species. A tax which is laid
on to pay for a dog-kennel or a stable, might have saved a whole
village from going into ruin and decay: and the carriage that glitters
like a meteor along the streets of the metropolis, often deprives the
wretched inmate of the distant cottage of the chair he sits on, the
table be eats on, the bed he lies on. A street lined with coaches and
with beggars dying at the steps of the doors, gives a strong lesson to
common sense and political foresight, if not to humanity. A nation
cannot subsist on unproductive labour, on war and taxes, or be
composed merely of parish and state paupers. All unproductive
labour is supported by productive labour. All persons maintained by
the taxes or employed by those who are maintained by them are a
clog, a dead weight upon those who pay them, that consume the
produce of the State, and add nothing to it—a dead carcase fastened
to a living one, with this difference, that it still devours the food
which it does not provide. Need we ask any farther, how war and
taxes, sinecures and monopolies, by degrees, weaken, impoverish, and
ruin a State? Or whether they can go on increasing for ever?
There is an excess of inequality and oppression, of luxury and want,
which no state can survive; as there is a point at which the palsied
frame can no longer support itself, and at which the withered tree falls
to the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the sovereign of a country were to employ the whole population
in doing nothing but throwing stones into the sea, he would soon
become the king of a desert island. If a sovereign exhausts the
wealth and strength of a country in war, he will end in being a king
of slaves and beggars. The national debt is just the measure, the
check-account of the labour and resources of the country which have
been so wasted—of the stones we have been throwing into the sea.
This debt is in fact an obligation entered into by the government on
the part of the tax-payers, to indemnify the tax-receivers for their
sacrifices in enabling the government to carry on the war. It is a
power of attorney, extorted from nine-tenths of the community,
making over to the remaining tenth an unlimited command over the
resources, the comforts, the labour, the happiness and liberty of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>great mass of society, by which their resources, their comforts, their
labour, their happiness, and their liberty, have been lost, and made
away with in government knick-knacks, and the kickshaws of
legitimacy. Half the resources and productive labour of the country
for the last twenty years, have been sunk in this debt, and we are now
called upon to make good the deficiency—how we can!—It has been
shrewdly asked, whether, if every one paid a hundred <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per cent.</span></i>
income tax, the nation could flourish? And when we are told that
‘the war has been a <em>customer</em> to the country for a length of time to
the amount of fifty millions a year,’ that is, has drained that sum
from the pockets of the nation to employ the hands of the nation in
<em>producing nothing</em>—we are at no loss to account for the consequences.
A writer, whose own fault it is that we do not feel all the respect for
him we could wish, has ridiculed the idea of a nation being in debt
to itself, ‘like a tradesman to his creditors,’ and contends that ‘a
much fairer instance would be that of a husband and wife playing
cards at the same table against each other, where what the one loses,
the other gains.’ Now men and their wives do not usually pay one
another the money they lose at cards; and most people will be ready
enough to reduce this simile to practice, by not paying the taxes,
whenever the author shall have convinced Mr. Vansittart, that it is
no matter whether the money is in the hands of the people or the
government, and that to save trouble it had better remain where it
is. Mr. Southey, in his late pamphlet, has very emphatically
described the different effects of money laid out in war and peace.
‘What bounds,’ he exclaims, ‘could imagination set to the welfare
and glory of this island, if a tenth part, or even a twentieth of what
the war expenditure has been, were annually applied in improving and
creating harbours, in bringing roads to the best possible repair, in
colonizing upon our waste lands, in reclaiming fens, and conquering
tracts from the sea, in encouraging the liberal arts, endowing schools
and churches,’ &amp;c. This is a singular slip of the pen in so noisy and
triumphant a war-monger as the Poet Laureate. But logical inconsistency
seems to be a sort of poetical license. Even in contradicting
himself, he is not right. For the money as he proposes to employ it,
would only degenerate into so many government jobs, and the low-lived
mummery of Bible Societies. The pinnacle of prosperity and
glory to which he would by these means raise the country, does not
seem quite so certain. The other extreme of distress and degradation,
to which the war-system has reduced it, is deep and deplorable
indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not without reluctance that we speak of the vices and infirmities
of such a mind as Burke’s: but the poison of high example has by
far the widest range of destruction: and, for the sake of public
honour and individual integrity, we think it right to say, that however
it may be defended upon other grounds, the political career of that
eminent individual has no title to the praise of consistency. Mr.
Burke, the opponent of the American war, and Mr. Burke, the
opponent of the French Revolution, are not the same person, but
opposite persons—not opposite persons only, but deadly enemies. In
the latter period, he abandoned not only all his practical conclusions,
but all the principles on which they were founded. He proscribed
all his former sentiments, denounced all his former friends, rejected
and reviled all the maxims to which he had formerly appealed as
incontestable. In the American war, he constantly spoke of the
rights of the people as inherent, and inalienable: after the French
Revolution, he began by treating them with the chicanery of a sophist,
and ended by raving at them with the fury of a maniac. In the
former case, he held out the duty of resistance to oppression, as the
palladium and only ultimate resource of natural liberty; in the latter,
he scouted, prejudged, vilified, and nicknamed, all resistance in the
abstract, as a foul and unnatural union of rebellion and sacrilege. In
the one case, to answer the purposes of faction, he made it out, that
the people are always in the right; in the other, to answer different
ends, he made it out that they are always in the wrong—lunatics in
the hands of their royal keepers, patients in the sick-wards of an
hospital, or felons in the condemned cells of a prison. In the one,
he considered that there was a constant tendency on the part of the
prerogative to encroach on the rights of the people, which ought
always to be the object of the most watchful jealousy, and of
resistance, when necessary: in the other, he pretended to regard it as
the sole occupation and ruling passion of those in power, to watch
over the liberties and happiness of their subjects. The burthen of all
his speeches on the American war, was conciliation, concession,
timely reform, as the only practicable or desirable alternative of
rebellion: the object of all his writings on the French Revolution
was, to deprecate and explode all concession and all reform, as
encouraging rebellion, and as an irretrievable step to revolution and
anarchy. In the one, he insulted kings personally, as among the
lowest and worst of mankind; in the other, he held them up to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>imagination of his readers, as sacred abstractions. In the one case,
he was a partisan of the people, to court popularity; in the other, to
gain the favour of the Court, he became the apologist of all courtly
abuses. In the one case, he took part with those who were actually
rebels against his Sovereign: in the other, he denounced as rebels
and traitors, all those of his own countrymen who did not yield
sympathetic allegiance to a foreign Sovereign, whom we had always
been in the habit of treating as an arbitrary tyrant.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nobody will accuse the principles of his present Majesty, or the
general measures of his reign, of inconsistency. If they had no other
merit, they have, at least, that of having been all along actuated by
one uniform and constant spirit: yet Mr. Burke at one time vehemently
opposed, and afterwards most intemperately extolled them: and it
was for his recanting his opposition, not for his persevering in it, that
he received his pension. He does not himself mention his flaming
speeches in the American war, as among the public services which
had entitled him to this remuneration.</p>

<p class='c010'>The truth is, that Burke was a man of fine fancy and subtle
reflection; but not of sound and practical judgment, nor of high or
rigid principles.—As to his understanding, he certainly was not a
great philosopher; for his works of mere abstract reasoning are
shallow and inefficient:—nor was he a man of sense and business;
for, both in counsel, and in conduct, he alarmed his friends as much
at least as his opponents:—but he was an acute and accomplished man
of letters—an ingenious political essayist. He applied the habit of
reflection, which he had borrowed from his metaphysical studies, but
which was not competent to the discovery of any elementary truth in
that department, with great facility and success, to the mixed mass of
human affairs. He knew more of the political machine than a recluse
philosopher; and he speculated more profoundly on its principles and
general results than a mere politician. He saw a number of fine
distinctions and changeable aspects of things, the good mixed with
the ill, and the ill mixed with the good; and with a sceptical
indifference, in which the exercise of his own ingenuity was obviously
the governing principle, suggested various topics to qualify or assist
the judgment of others. But for this very reason, he was little
calculated to become a leader or a partizan in any important practical
measure. For the habit of his mind would lead him to find out a
reason for or against any thing: and it is not on speculative refinements,
(which belong to <em>every</em> side of a question), but on a just
estimate of the aggregate mass and extended combinations of objections
and advantages, that we ought to decide or act. Burke had the
power of throwing true or false weights into the scales of political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>casuistry, but not firmness of mind (or, shall we say, honesty enough)
to hold the balance. When he took a side, his vanity or his spleen
more frequently gave the casting vote than his judgment; and the
fieriness of his zeal was in exact proportion to the levity of his understanding,
and the want of conscious sincerity.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was fitted by nature and habit for the studies and labours of
the closet; and was generally mischievous when he came out; because
the very subtlety of his reasoning, which, left to itself, would have
counteracted its own activity, or found its level in the common sense
of mankind, became a dangerous engine in the hands of power, which
is always eager to make use of the most plausible pretexts to cover
the most fatal designs. That which, if applied as a general observation
to human affairs, is a valuable truth suggested to the mind, may,
when forced into the interested defence of a particular measure or
system, become the grossest and basest sophistry. Facts or consequences
never stood in the way of this speculative politician. He
fitted them to his preconceived theories, instead of conforming his
theories to them. They were the playthings of his style, the sport
of his fancy. They were the straws of which his imagination made
a blaze, and were consumed, like straws, in the blaze they had served
to kindle. The fine things he said about Liberty and Humanity, in
his speech on the Begum’s affairs, told equally well, whether Warren
Hastings was a tyrant or not: nor did he care one jot who caused
the famine he described, so that he described it in a way that no one
else could. On the same principle, he represented the French priests
and nobles under the old regime as excellent moral people, very
charitable and very religious, in the teeth of notorious facts—to
answer to the handsome things he had to say in favour of priesthood
and nobility in general; and, with similar views, he falsifies the
records of our English Revolution, and puts an interpretation on the
word <em>abdication</em>, of which a school-boy would be ashamed. He constructed
his whole theory of government, in short, not on rational,
but on picturesque and fanciful principles; as if the king’s crown
were a painted gewgaw, to be looked at on gala-days; titles an empty
sound to please the ear; and the whole order of society a theatrical
procession. His lamentations over the age of chivalry, and his
projected crusade to restore it, are about as wise as if any one, from
reading the Beggar’s Opera, should take to picking of pockets: or,
from admiring the landscapes of Salvator Rosa, should wish to convert
the abodes of civilized life into the haunts of wild beasts and banditti.
On this principle of false refinement, there is no abuse, nor system of
abuses, that does not admit of an easy and triumphant defence; for
there is something which a merely speculative enquirer may always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>find out, good as well as bad, in every possible system, the best or the
worst; and if we can once get rid of the restraints of common sense
and honesty, we may easily prove, by plausible words, that liberty
and slavery, peace and war, plenty and famine, are matters of perfect
indifference. This is the school of politics, of which Mr. Burke was
at the head; and it is perhaps to his example, in this respect, that we
owe the prevailing tone of many of those newspaper paragraphs,
which Mr. Coleridge thinks so invaluable an accession to our political
philosophy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Burke’s literary talents were, after all, his chief excellence. His
style has all the familiarity of conversation, and all the research of the
most elaborate composition. He says what he wants to say, by any
means, nearer or more remote, within his reach. He makes use of
the most common or scientific terms, of the longest or shortest
sentences, of the plainest and most downright, or of the most figurative
modes of speech. He gives for the most part loose reins to his
imagination, and follows it as far as the language will carry him. As
long as the one or the other has any resources in store to make the
reader feel and see the thing as he has conceived it, in its nicest
shades of difference, in its utmost degree of force and splendour, he
never disdains, and never fails to employ them. Yet, in the extremes
of his mixed style, there is not much affectation, and but little either
of pedantry or of coarseness. He everywhere gives the image he
wishes to give, in its true and appropriate colouring: and it is the
very crowd and variety of these images that has given to his language
its peculiar tone of animation, and even of passion. It is his
impatience to transfer his conceptions entire, living, in all their rapidity,
strength, and glancing variety, to the minds of others, that constantly
pushes him to the verge of extravagance, and yet supports him there
in dignified security—</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>He is the most poetical of our prose writers, and at the same time
his prose never degenerates into the mere effeminacy of poetry; for
he always aims at overpowering rather than at pleasing; and consequently
sacrifices beauty and delicacy to force and vividness. He
has invariably a task to perform, a positive purpose to execute,
an effect to produce. His only object is therefore to strike hard,
and in the right place; if he misses his mark, he repeats his blow;
and does not care how ungraceful the action, or how clumsy the
instrument, provided it brings down his antagonist.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not interest alone, but prejudice or fashion that sways mankind.
Opinion governs opinion. It is not merely what we can get
by a certain line of conduct that we have to consider, but what
others will think of it. The possession of money is but one mode of
recommending ourselves to the good opinion of the world, of securing
distinction and respect. Except as a bribe to popularity, money is of
very limited value. Avarice is (oftener than we might at first suspect)
only vanity in disguise. We should not want fine clothes or fine
houses, an equipage or livery-servants, but for what others will think
of us for having or wanting them. The chief and most expensive
commodity that money is laid out in purchasing, is respect. Money,
like other things, is worth no more than it will fetch. It is a passport
into society; but if other things will answer the same purpose,
as beauty, birth, wit, learning, desert in art or arms, dress, behaviour,
the want of wealth is not felt as a very severe privation. If a man,
who, on whatever pretensions is received into good company, behaves
with propriety, and converses rationally, it is not inquired after
he is gone, nor once thought of while he is present, whether he is
rich or poor. In the mixed intercourse of private society every
one finds his level, in proportion as he can contribute to its amusement
or information. It is even more so in the general intercourse
of the world, where a poet and a man of genius (if extrinsic
circumstances make any difference) is as much courted and
run after for being a common ploughman, as for being a peer of
the realm. Burns, had he been living, would have started fair
with Lord Byron in the race of popularity, and would not have
lost it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The temptation to men in public life to swerve from the path
of duty, less frequently arises from a sordid regard to their private
interests, than from an undue deference to popular applause. A
want of political principle is, in nine cases out of ten, a want of
firmness of mind to differ with those around us, and to stand the
brunt of their avowed hostility or secret calumnies.</p>

<p class='c013'>An honest man is one whose sense of right and wrong is stronger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>than his anxiety that others should think or speak well of him. A
man in the same sense forfeits his character for political integrity,
whose love of truth truckles to his false shame and cringing complaisance,
and who tampers with his own convictions, that he
may stand well with the world. A man who sells his opinion
merely to gain by his profligacy, is not a man without public
principle, but common honesty. He ranks in the same class with
a highwayman or a pickpocket.—It is true, interest and opinion
are in general linked together; but opinion flies before, and interest
comes limping after. As a woman first loses her virtue
through her heart, so the yielding patriot generally sacrifices his
character to his love of reputation.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is usually opposed by those who make no distinction between
the highest point of integrity and the lowest mercenariness, that
Mr. Burke changed his principles to gain a pension: and that
this was the main-spring of his subsequent conduct. We do not
think so; though this may have been one motive, and a strong one
to a needy and extravagant man. But the pension which he
received was something more than a mere grant of money—it was
a mark of royal favour, it was a tax upon public opinion. If any
thing were wanting to fix his veering loyalty, it was the circumstance
of the king’s having his ‘Reflections on the French Revolution’
bound in morocco (not an unsuitable binding), and giving
it to all his particular friends, saying, ‘It was a book which every
gentleman ought to read!’ This praise would go as far with a vain
man as a pension with a needy one; and we may be sure, that if
there were any lurking seeds of a leaning to the popular side remaining
in the author’s breast, he would after this lose no time in
rooting them out of the soil, that his works might reflect the perfect
image of his royal master’s mind, and have no plebeian stains
left to sully it. Kings are great critics: they are the fountain of
honour; the judges of merit. After such an authority had pronounced
it ‘a book which every gentleman ought to read,’ what
gentleman could refuse to read, or dare to differ with it? With what
feelings a privy-counsellor would open the leaves of a book, which
the king had had richly bound, and presented with his own hand!
How lords of the bed-chamber would wonder at the profound
arguments! How peeresses in their own right must simper over
the beautiful similes! How the judges must puzzle over it!
How the bishops would bless themselves at the number of fine
things; and our great classical scholars, Doctors Parr and Burney,
sit down for the first time in their lives to learn English, to
write themselves into a bishopric! Burke had long laboured hard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>to attain a doubtful pre-eminence. He had worked his way into
public notice by talents which were thought specious rather than
solid, and by sentiments which were obnoxious to some, suspected
by others. His connexions and his views were ambiguous. He
professedly espoused the cause of the people, and found it as hard
to defend himself against popular jealousy as ministerial resentment.
He saw court-lacqueys put over his head; and country
squires elbowing him aside. He was neither understood by
friends nor enemies. He was opposed, thwarted, cross-questioned,
and obliged to present ‘a certificate of merit’ (as he himself
says) at every stage of his progress through life. But the king’s
having pronounced that ‘his book was one which every gentleman
ought to read,’ floated him at once out of the flats and
shallows in which his voyage of popularity had been bound, into
the full tide of court-favour; settled all doubts; smoothed all
difficulties; rubbed off old scores; made the crooked straight, and
the rough plain;—what was obscure, became profound;—what
was extravagant, lofty; every sentiment was liberality, every expression
elegance: and from that time to this, Burke has been
the oracle of every dull venal pretender to taste or wisdom.
Those who had never heard of or despised him before, now
joined in his praise. He became a fashion; he passed into a
proverb; he was an idol in the eyes of his readers, as much as
he could ever, in the days of his youthful vanity, have been in
his own; he was dazzled with his own popularity; and all this
was owing to the king. No wonder he was delighted with the
change, infatuated with it, infuriated! It was better to him than
four thousand pounds a-year for his own life, and fifteen hundred
a-year to his widow during the joint-lives of four other persons.
It was what all his life he had been aiming at.—‘Thou hast it
now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all!’ It was what the nurses had
prophecied of him, and what the school-boy had dreamt; and
that which is first, is also last in our thoughts. It was this that
tickled his vanity more than his pension: it was this that raised
his gratitude, that melted his obdurate pride, that opened the
sluices of his heart to the poison of corruption, that exorcised the
low, mechanic, vulgar, morose, sour principles of liberty clean
out of him, left his mind ‘swept and garnished,’ parched and dry,
fevered with revenge, bloated with adulation; and made him as
shameless and abandoned in sacrificing every feeling of attachment or
obligation to the people, as he had before been bold and prodigal in
heaping insult and contumely upon the throne. He denounced his
former principles, in the true spirit of an apostate, with a fury equal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>to the petulant and dogmatical tone in which he had asserted them;
and then proceeded to abuse all those who doubted the honesty or
wisdom of this change of opinion. He, in short, looked upon every
man as his enemy who did not think ‘his book fit for a gentleman to
read’; and would willingly have committed every such presumptuous
sceptic to the flames for not bowing down in servile adoration before
this idol of his vanity and reputation. Hence the frantic philippics
in his latter revolutionary speeches and writings, and the alteration
from a severe and stately style of eloquence and reasoning in his
earlier compositions to the most laboured paradoxes and wildest
declamation. We do not mean to say that his latest works did not
display the greatest genius. His native talents blazed out, undisguised
and unconfined in them. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Indignatio facit versus.</span></i> Burke’s best Muse
was his vanity or spleen. He felt quite at home in giving vent to
his personal spite and venal malice. He pleaded his own cause and
the cause of the passions better and with more eloquence, than he
ever pleaded the cause of truth and justice. He felt the one rankling
in his heart with all their heat and fury; he only conceived the other
with his understanding coldly and circuitously.—The ‘Letters of
William Burke’ give one, however, a low idea of Burke’s honesty,
even in a pecuniary point of view.—(See Barry’s ‘Life.’) He
constantly tells Barry, as a source of consolation to his friend, and a
compliment to his brother, ‘that though his party had not hitherto
been successful, or had not considered him as they ought, matters
were not so bad with him but that he could still afford to be honest,
and not desert the cause.’ This is very suspicious. This querulous
tone of disappointment, and cockering up of his boasted integrity,
must have come from Burke himself; who would hardly have expressed
such a sentiment, if it had not been frequently in his thoughts;
or if he had not made out a previous debtor and creditor account
between preferment and honesty, as one of the regular principles of
his political creed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same narrow view of the subject, drawn from a supposition
that money, or interest in the grossest sense, is the only inducement
to a dereliction of principle or sinister conduct, has been applied to
shew the sincerity of the present laureate in his change of opinions;
for it was said that the paltry salary of 100<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> a-year was not a sufficient
temptation to any man of common sense, and who had other means
of gaining an ample livelihood honourably, to give up his principles
and his party, unless he did so conscientiously. That is not the real
alternative of the case. It is not the hundred pounds salary; it is
the honour (some may think it a disgrace) conferred along with it,
that enhances the prize. ‘And with it words of so sweet breath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>composed, as made the gift more rare.’<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c011'><sup>[43]</sup></a> It is the introduction to
Carlton-House, the smile, the squeeze by the hand that awaits him
there, ‘escap’d from Pyrrho’s maze, and Epicurus’ sty.’ The being
presented at court is worth more than a hundred pounds a-year. A
person with a hundred thousand pounds a-year can only be presented
at court, and would consider it the greatest mortification to be shut
out. It is the highest honour in the land; and Mr. Southey, by
accepting his place and discarding his principles, receives that highest
honour as a matter of course, in addition to his salary and his butt of
sack. He is ushered into the royal presence as by a magic charm,
the palace-gates fly open at the sight of his laurel-crown, and he
stands in the midst of ‘Britain’s warriors, her statesman, and her
fair,’ as if suddenly dropped from the clouds. Is this nothing to a
vain man? Is it nothing to the author of ‘Wat Tyler’ and ‘Joan
of Arc’ to have those errors of his youth veiled in the honours of his
riper years? To fill the poetic throne of Dryden, of Shadwell, of
Cibber, and of Pye? To receive distinctions which Spenser,
Shakspeare, and Milton never received, and to chaunt to the unaverted
ear of sovereignty strains such as they never sung? To be
seen on each returning birth-day joining the bright throng, the
lengthened procession, gay, gilt, painted, coronetted, garlanded, that
as it passes to and from St. James’s, all London, in sunshine or in
shower, pours out to gaze at? We tremble for the consequences,
should any thing happen to disturb the Laureate in his dream of
perfect felicity. Racine died broken-hearted, because Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span>
frowned upon him as he passed; and yet Racine was as great a poet
and as pious a man as Mr. Southey.</p>

<p class='c010'>To move in the highest circles, to be in favour at courts, to be
familiar with princes, is then an object of ambition, which may be
supposed to fascinate a less romantic mind than Mr. Southey’s,
setting the lucrativeness of his conversion out of the question. Many
persons have paid dear for this proud elevation, with bankrupt health
and beggared fortunes. How many are ready to do so still! Mr.
Southey only paid for it <em>with his opinion</em>; and some people think it as
much as his opinion was worth. Are we to suppose Mr. Southey’s
vanity of so sordid a kind, that it must be bribed by his avarice?
Might not the Poet-laureate be supposed to catch at a title or a blue
ribbon, if it were offered him, without a round salary attached to it?</p>

<p class='c010'>Why do country gentlemen wish to get into parliament, but to be
seen there? Why do overgrown merchants and rich nabobs wish to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>sit there, like so many overgrown school-boys? Look at the hundreds
of thousands of pounds squandered in contested elections? It is not
‘gain but glory’ that provokes the combatants. Do you suppose
that these persons expect to repay themselves by making a market of
their constituents, and selling their votes to the best bidder? No:
but they wish to be thought to have the greatest influence, the greatest
number of friends and adherents in their county; and they will pay
any price for it. We put into the lottery, indeed, in hopes of what
we can get, but in the lottery of life honour is the great prize. It is
the opinion of the people for which the candidate at an election
contends; and on the same principles he will barter the opinion of
the people, their rights and liberty, and his own independence and
character, not for gold, but for the friendship of a court-favourite.
Not that gold has not its weight too, for the great and powerful have
that also to bestow:—it is true, that</p>

one, however mean or insignificant, whose approbation is altogether
indifferent to us; whose flattery does not please, whose contempt
does not mortify us. There is an atmosphere of this sort always
about us, from which we can no more withdraw ourselves than from
the air we breathe. But the air of a Court is the concentrated
essence of the opinion of the world. The atmosphere there is
mephitic. It is subtle poison, the least exhalation of which taints
the vitals of its victims. It is made up of servile adulation, of sneering

Let us see how its influence descends:—from the King to the
people, to his Ministers first, from the Ministers to both Houses of
Parliament, from Lords to Ladies, from the Clergy to the Laity,
from the high to the low, from the rich to the poor, and ‘pierces
through the body of the city, country, court’—it is beauty, birth,
wit, learning, riches, numbers: it is fear and favour; it has all the
splendour that can seduce, all the power that can intimidate, all the
interest that can corrupt, on its side; so that the opinion of the
King is the opinion of the nation; and if that opinion is not a wise
one, hangs like a millstone round its neck, oppresses it like a nightmare,
weighs upon it like lead, makes truth a lie, right wrong,
converts liberty into slavery, peace into war, plenty to famine, turns
the heads of a whole people, and bows their bodies to the earth.
‘Whosoever shall stumble against this stone, it shall bruise him: but
whomsoever it falls upon, it shall grind him to powder.’ The
whisper of a King rounded in the ear of a favourite is re-echoed
back in speeches and votes of Parliament, in addresses and resolutions
from associations in town and country, drawls from the pulpit, brawls
from the bar, resounds like the thunder of a people’s voice, roars in
the cannon’s mouth, and disturbs the peace of nations. The frown
of monarchs is like the speck seen in the distant horizon, which soon
spreads and darkens the whole hemisphere. Who is there in his
senses that can withstand the gathering storm, or oppose himself to
this torrent of opinion setting in upon him from the throne and
absorbing by degrees every thing in its vortex—undermining every
principle of independence, confounding every distinction of the understanding,
and obliterating every trace of liberty? To argue against
it, is like arguing against the motion of the world with which we are
carried along: its influence is as powerful and as imperceptible. To
question it, is folly; to resist it, madness. To differ with the
opinion of a whole nation, seems as presumptuous as it is unwise:
and yet the very circumstance which makes it so uniform, is that
which makes it worth nothing. Authority is more absolute than
reason. Truth curtesies to power. No arguments could persuade
ten millions of men in one country to be all of one mind, and thirty
millions in another country to be of just the contrary one; but the
word of a King does it! We do not like to differ from the company
we are in. How much more difficult is it to brave the opinion of
the world! No man likes to be frowned out of society. No man
likes to be without sympathy. He must be a proud man indeed who
can do without it; and proud men do not like to be made a mark for
‘scorn to point his slow and moving finger at.’ No man likes to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>thought the enemy of his king and country, without just cause. No
man likes to be called a fool or a knave, merely because he is not a
fool and a knave. It is not desirable to have to answer arguments
backed with informations filed <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</span></i>; it is not amusing to become
a bye-word with the mob. A nickname is <em>the hardest stone that the
devil can throw at a man</em>. It will knock down any man’s resolution.
It will stagger his reason. It will tame his pride. Fasten it upon
any man, and he will try to shake it off, at any rate, though he
should part with honour and honesty along with it. To be shut out
from public praise or private friendship, to be lampooned in newspapers
or Anti-Jacobin reviews, to be looked blank upon in company, is not
‘a consummation devoutly to be wished.’ The unfavourable opinion
of others gives you a bad opinion of yourself or them: and neither of
these conduces to persevering, high-minded integrity. To wish to
serve mankind, we should think well of them. To be able to serve
them, they should think well of us. To keep well with the public,
is not more necessary to a man’s private interest than to his general
utility. It is a hopeless task to be always striving against the
stream: it is a thankless one to be in a state of perpetual litigation
with the community. The situation of a strange dog in a country
town, barked at and worried by all the curs in the village, is about as
enviable as that of a person who affects singularity in politics. What
is a man to do who gets himself into this predicament, in an age
when patriotism is a misnomer in language, and public principle a
solecism in fact? If he cannot bring the world round to his opinion,
he must as a forlorn hope go over to theirs, and be content to be
knave—or nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such is the force of opinion, that we would undertake to drive a
first Minister from his place and out of the country, by merely being
allowed to hire a number of dirty boys to hoot him along the streets
from his own house to the treasury and from the treasury back again.
How would a certain distinguished character, remarkable for uniting
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">suaviter in modo</span></i> with the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fortiter in re</span></i>, and who, with an
invariable consistency in his political principles, carries the easiness
of his temper to a degree of apparent <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">non-chalance</span></i>, bear to have a
starling in his neighbourhood taught to repeat nothing but Walcheren,
or to ring the changes in his ears upon the names of Castles, Oliver,
and Reynolds? Can we wonder then at the feats which such
Ministers have performed with the Attorney-General at their backs,
and the country at their heels, in full cry against every one who was
not a creature of the Ministers,—for whose morals they could not
vouch as government-spies, or whose talents they did not reward as
government-critics?—Mr. Coleridge, in his Literary Biography, lately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>published, complains with pathetic bitterness of the wanton and wilful
slanders formerly circulated with so much zeal in the Anti-Jacobin
against himself, Mr. Southey, and his other poetical friends, merely
for a difference of political opinion; and he significantly assigns these
slanders as the reason why himself and his friends remained so long
adverse to the party who were the authors of them! We will
venture to go a little further, and say, that they were not only the
reason of their long estrangement from the Court-party, but of their
final reconciliation to it. They had time to balance and reflect, and
to make a choice of evils—they deliberated between the loss of
principle and of character, and they were undone. They thought it
better to be the accomplices of venality and corruption than the mark
for them to shoot their arrows at: they took shelter from the abuse
by joining in the cry. Mr. Southey says that he has not changed
his principles, but that circumstances have changed, and that he has
grown wiser from the events of five-and-twenty years. How is it
that his present friend and associate in the Quarterly Review, who
was formerly a contributor to the Beauties of the Anti-Jacobin, has
not changed too? The world has gone round in his time too, but he
remains firm to his first principles. He worships the sun wherever
he sees it. Court-favour, ‘the cynosure of longing eyes,’ sheds a
more steady influence on its votaries than vague popularity. The
confined, artificial air of a Court has a wonderful effect in stopping
that progress of the mind with the march of events, of which
Mr. Southey boasts, and prematurely fixes the volatility of genius
in a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i> of prejudice and servility, in those who are
admitted within the magic circle! The Anti-Jacobin poet and
orator, Mr. Canning, has not become a renegado to the opinions of
the Court: the Jacobin poet and prose-writer, Mr. Southey, has
become a renegado to his own.—In an article in the Quarterly
Review (some months back) there was an argument to shew that
the late war against France was all along the undoubted result of
popular opinion, ‘because from the first party-spirit ran so high upon
this subject, that any one who expressed an opinion against it did so
at the hazard of his reputation, fortune, or even life.’ The author
of this singular argument, we believe, was one of those, who did not
at the critical period here alluded to approve of it, and who has since
become a convert to its justice and humanity. His own statement
may account for his change of opinion. What a pity for a man to
hazard his life and fortune in a cause by maintaining an opinion, and
to lose his character afterwards by relinquishing it. The present
Poet-laureate has missed indeed the crown of martyrdom, and has
gained a crown of laurel in its stead!</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>The same consistent writers, and friends of civil and religious
liberty, who are delighted with the restoration of the Bourbons, of
the Pope, and the Inquisition, have lately made an attempt to run
down the Dissenters in this country; and in this they are right.
They dwell with fondness on ‘the single-heartedness of the Spanish
nation,’ who are slaves and bigots to a man, and scoff at the
Presbyterians and Independents of this country (who ousted Popery
and slavery at the Revolution, and who had a main hand in placing
and continuing the present family on the throne) as but half-Englishmen,
and as equally disaffected to Church and State. There
is some ground for the antipathy of our political changelings to a
respectable, useful, and conscientious body of men: and we will
here, in discharge of an old debt, say what this ground is. If it
were only meant that the Dissenters are but half Englishmen, because
they are not professed slaves—that they are disaffected to the Constitution
in Church and State, because they are not prepared to go all
the lengths of despotism and intolerance under a Protestant hierarchy
and Constitutional King, which they resisted ‘at the peril of their
characters, their fortunes, and their lives,’ under a persecuting priesthood
and an hereditary Pretender, this would be well: but there is
more in it than this. Our sciolists would persuade us that the
different sects are hot-beds of sedition, because they are nurseries of
public spirit, and independence, and sincerity of opinion in all other
respects. They are so necessarily, and by the supposition. They
are Dissenters from the Established Church: they submit voluntarily
to certain privations, they incur a certain portion of obloquy and
ill-will, for the sake of what they believe to be the truth: they are
not time-servers on the face of the evidence, and that is sufficient to
expose them to the instinctive hatred and ready ribaldry of those who
think venality the first of virtues, and prostitution of principle the
best sacrifice a man can make to the Graces or his Country. The
Dissenter does not change his sentiments with the seasons: he does
not suit his conscience to his convenience. This is enough to
condemn him for a pestilent fellow. He will not give up his
principles because they are unfashionable, therefore he is not to be
trusted. He speaks his mind bluntly and honestly, therefore he is a
secret disturber of the peace, a dark conspirator against the State.
On the contrary, the different sects in this country are, or have been,
the steadiest supporters of its liberties and laws: they are checks and
barriers against the insidious or avowed encroachments of arbitrary
power, as effectual and indispensable as any others in the Constitution:
they are depositaries of a principle as sacred and somewhat rarer than
a devotion to Court-influence—we mean the love of truth. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>hard for any one to be an honest politician who is not born and bred
a Dissenter. Nothing else can sufficiently inure and steel a man
against the prevailing prejudices of the world, but that habit of mind
which arises from non-conformity to its decisions in matters of
religion. There is a natural alliance between the love of civil and
religious liberty, as much as between Church and State. Protestantism
was the first school of political liberty in Europe: Presbyterianism
has been one great support of it in England. The sectary in religion
is taught to appeal to his own bosom for the truth and sincerity of
his opinions, and to arm himself with stern indifference to what
others think of them. This will no doubt often produce a certain
hardness of manner and cold repulsiveness of feeling in trifling matters,
but it is the only sound discipline of truth, or inflexible honesty in
politics as well as in religion. The same principle of independent
inquiry and unbiassed conviction which makes him reject all undue
interference between his Maker and his conscience, will give a
character of uprightness and disregard of personal consequences to
his conduct and sentiments in what concerns the most important
relations between man and man. He neither subscribes to the dogmas
of priests, nor truckles to the mandates of Ministers. He has a rigid
sense of duty which renders him superior to the caprice, the
prejudices, and the injustice of the world; and the same habitual
consciousness of rectitude of purpose, which leads him to rely for his
self-respect on the testimony of his own heart, enables him to disregard
the groundless malice and rash judgments of his opponents.
It is in vain for him to pay his court to the world, to fawn upon
power; he labours under certain insurmountable disabilities for
becoming a candidate for its favour: he dares to contradict its
opinion and to condemn its usages in the most important article of
all. The world will always look cold and askance upon him; and
therefore he may defy it with less fear of its censures. The
Presbyterian is said to be sour: he is not therefore over-complaisant—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>‘Or if severe in thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘The love he bears to virtue is in fault.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Dissenters are the safest partizans, and the steadiest friends. Indeed
they are almost the only people who have an idea of an abstract
attachment to a cause or to individuals, from a sense of fidelity,
independently of prosperous or adverse circumstances, and in spite
of opposition. No patriotism, no public spirit, not reared in that
inclement sky and harsh soil, in ‘the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">hortus siccus</span></i> of dissent,’ will
generally last: it will either bend in the storm or droop in the
sunshine. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non ex quovis ligno fit Mercurius.</span></i> You cannot engraft a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>medlar on a crab-apple. A thorough-bred Dissenter will never make
an accomplished Courtier. The antithesis of a Presbyterian Divine
of the old school is the Poet-laureate of the new. We have known
instances of both; and give it decidedly in favour of old-fashioned
honesty over new-fangled policy.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have known instances of both. The one we would willingly
forget; the others we hope never to forget, nor can we ever. A
Poet-laureate is an excrescence even in a Court; he is doubly
nugatory as a Courtier and a Poet; he is a refinement upon insignificance,
and a superfluous piece of supererogation. But a
Dissenting Minister is a character not so easily to be dispensed
with, and whose place cannot well be supplied. It is the fault of
sectarianism that it tends to scepticism; and so relaxes the springs
of moral courage and patience into levity and indifference. The
prospect of future rewards and punishments is a useful set-off against
the immediate distribution of places and pensions; the anticipations
of faith call off our attention from the grosser illusions of sense. It
is a pity that this character has worn itself out; that that pulse
of thought and feeling has ceased almost to beat in the heart of a
nation, who, if not remarkable for sincerity and plain downright
well-meaning, are remarkable for nothing. But we have known some
such, in happier days; who had been brought up and lived from
youth to age in the one constant belief of God and of his Christ, and
who thought all other things but dross compared with the glory
hereafter to be revealed. Their youthful hopes and vanity had been
mortified in them, even in their boyish days, by the neglect and
supercilious regards of the world; and they turned to look into their
own minds for something else to build their hopes and confidence
upon. They were true Priests. They set up an image in their own
minds, it was truth: they worshipped an idol there, it was justice.
They looked on man as their brother, and only bowed the knee to
the Highest. Separate from the world, they walked humbly with
their God, and lived in thought with those who had borne testimony
of a good conscience, with the spirits of just men in all ages. They
saw Moses when he slew the Egyptian, and the Prophets who
overturned the brazen images; and those who were stoned and sawn
asunder. They were with Daniel in the lions’ den, and with the
three children who passed through the fiery furnace, Meshech,
Shadrach, and Abednego; they did not crucify Christ twice over, or
deny him in their hearts, with St. Peter; the Book of Martyrs was
open to them; they read the story of William Tell, of John Huss
and Jerome of Prague, and the old one-eyed Zisca; they had Neale’s
History of the Puritans by heart, and Calamy’s Account of the Two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Thousand Ejected Ministers, and gave it to their children to read,
with the pictures of the polemical Baxter, the silver-tongued Bates,
the mild-looking Calamy, and old honest Howe; they believed in
Lardner’s Credibility of the Gospel History: they were deep-read
in the works of the <i><span lang="pl" xml:lang="pl">Fratres Poloni</span></i>, Pripscovius, Crellius,
Cracovius, who sought out truth in texts of Scripture, and grew
blind over Hebrew points; their aspiration after liberty was a
sigh uttered from the towers, ‘time-rent,’ of the Holy Inquisition;
and their zeal for religious toleration was kindled at the fires of
Smithfield. Their sympathy was not with the oppressors, but the
oppressed. They cherished in their thoughts—and wished to transmit
to their posterity—those rights and privileges for asserting which their
ancestors had bled on scaffolds, or had pined in dungeons, or in
foreign climes. Their creed too was ‘Glory to God, peace on earth,
good will to man.’ This creed, since profaned and rendered vile,
they kept fast through good report and evil report. This belief they
had, that looks at something out of itself, fixed as the stars, deep as
the firmament, that makes of its own heart an altar to truth, a place
of worship for what is right, at which it does reverence with praise
and prayer like a holy thing, apart and content: that feels that the
greatest being in the universe is always near it, and that all things
work together for the good of his creatures, under his guiding hand.
This covenant they kept, as the stars keep their courses: this
principle they stuck by, for want of knowing better, as it sticks by
them to the last. It grew with their growth, it does not wither in
their decay. It lives when the almond-tree flourishes, and is not
bowed down with the tottering knees. It glimmers with the last
feeble eyesight, smiles in the faded cheek like infancy, and lights a
path before them to the grave!—This is better than the life of a
whirligig Court poet.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The clerical character has, no doubt, its excellences, which have been
often insisted on: it has also its faults, which cannot be corrected or
guarded against, unless they are pointed out. The following are
some of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first, and most obvious objection we have to it, arises from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>the dress. All artificial distinctions of this kind have a tendency to
warp the understanding and sophisticate the character. They create
egotism. A man is led to think of himself more than he should, who
by any outward marks of distinction invites others to fix their attention
on him. They create affectation; for they make him study to
be not like himself, but like his dress. They create hypocrisy; for
as his thoughts and feelings cannot be as uniform and mechanical as
his dress, he must be constantly tempted to make use of the one as a
cloak to the other, and to conceal the defects or aberrations of his
mind by a greater primness of professional costume, or a more
mysterious carriage of his person—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——‘And in Franciscan think to pass disguised.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>No man of the ordinary stamp can retain a downright unaffected
simplicity of character who is always reminding others, and reminded
himself, of his pretensions to superior piety and virtue by a conventional
badge, which implies neither one nor the other, and which
must gradually accustom the mind to compromise appearances for
reality, the form for the power of godliness. We do not care to
meet the Lawyers fluttering about Chancery-lane in their full-bottomed
wigs and loose silk gowns: their dress seems to sit as loose upon
them as their opinions, and they wear their own hair under the well-powdered
dangling curls, as they bury the sense of right and wrong
under the intricate and circuitous forms of law: but we hate much
more to meet a three-cornered well-pinched clerical hat on a prim
expectant pair of shoulders, that seems to announce to half a street
before it, that sees the theological puppet coming, with a mingled air
of humility and self-conceit—‘Stand off, for I am holier than you.’
We are not disposed to submit to this pharisaical appeal; we are
more inclined to resent than to sympathise with the claims to our
respect, which are thus mechanically perked in our faces. The dress
of the bar merely implies a professional indifference to truth or falsehood
in those who wear it, and they seldom carry it out of Court:
the dress of the pulpit implies a greater gravity of pretension; and
they therefore stick to it as closely as to a doublet and hose of
religion and morality. If the reverend persons who are thus clothed
with righteousness as with a garment, are sincere in their professions,
it is well: if they are hypocrites, it is also well. It is no wonder
that the class of persons so privileged are tenacious of the respect that
is paid to the cloth; that their tenderness on this subject is
strengthened by all the incentives of self-love; by the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i>;
by the indirect implication of religion itself in any slight put upon its
authorised Ministers; and that the deliberate refusal to acknowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>the gratuitous claims which are thus set up to our blind homage, is
treated as a high offence against the good order of society in the
present world, and threatened with exemplary punishment in the next.
There is nothing fair or manly in all this. It is levying a tax on our
respect under fraudulent, or at best, equivocal pretences. There is no
manner of connexion between the thing and the symbol of it, to which
public opinion is expected to bow. The whole is an affair of dress—a
dull masquerade. There is no proof of the doctrine of the Trinity
in a three-cornered hat, nor does a black coat without a cape imply
sincerity and candour. A man who wishes to pass for a saint or a
philosopher on the strength of a button in his hat or a buckle in his
shoes, is not very likely to be either; as the button in the hat or the
buckle in the shoes will answer all the same purpose with the vulgar,
and save time and trouble. Those who make their dress a principal
part of themselves, will, in general, become of no more value than
their dress. Their understandings will receive a costume. Their
notions will be as stiff and starched as their bands; their morals
strait-laced and ricketty; their pretended creed formal and out of
date; and they themselves a sort of demure lay-figures, sombre Jacks-of-the-Green,
to carry about the tattered fragments and hoarded relics
of bigotry and superstition, which, when they no longer awe the
imagination or impose on credulity, only insult the understanding and
excite contempt.—No one who expects you to pay the same regard
to the cut or colour of his coat as to what he says or does, will be
anxious to set an exclusive value on what can alone entitle him to
respect. You are to take his merit for granted on the score of
civility, and he will take it for granted himself on the score of convenience.
He will do all he can to keep up the farce. These
gentlemen find it no hardship</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This canonical standard of moral estimation is too flattering to their
pride and indolence to be parted with in a hurry; and nothing will
try their patience or provoke their humility so much as to suppose
that there is any truer stamp of merit than the badge of their profession.
It has been contended, that more is made here of the
clerical dress than it is meant to imply; that it is simply a mark of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>distinction, to know the individuals of that particular class of society
from others, and that they ought to be charged with affectation, or an
assumption of self-importance for wearing it, no more than a waterman,
a fireman, or a chimney-sweeper, for appearing in the streets in their
appropriate costume. We do not think ‘the collusion holds in the
exchange.’ If a chimney-sweeper were to jostle a spruce divine in
the street, which of them would ejaculate the word ‘Fellow’? The
humility of the churchman would induce him to lift up his cane at
the sooty professor, but the latter would hardly take his revenge by
raising his brush and shovel, as equally respectable insignia of office.
As to the watermen and firemen, they do not, by the badges of their
trade, claim any particular precedence in moral accomplishments, nor
are their jacket and trowsers hieroglyphics of any particular creed,
which others are bound to believe on pain of damnation. It is there
the shoe pinches. Where external dress really denotes distinction of
rank in other cases, as in the dress of officers in the army, those who
might avail themselves of this distinction lay it aside as soon as
possible; and, unless very silly fellows or very great coxcombs, do
not choose to be made a gazing-stock to women and children. But
there is in the clerical habit something too sacred to be lightly put
on or off: <em>once a priest, and always a priest</em>: it adheres to them as
a part of their function; it is the outward and visible sign of an
inward and invisible grace; it is a light that must not be hid; it is
a symbol of godliness, an edifying spectacle, an incentive to good
morals, a discipline of humanity, and a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">memento mori</span></i>, which cannot be
too often before us. To lay aside their habit, would be an unworthy
compromise of the interests of both worlds. It would be a sort of
denying Christ. They therefore venture out into the streets with
this gratuitous obtrusion of opinion and unwarrantable assumption of
character wrapped about them, ticketted and labelled with the
Thirty-nine Articles, St. Athanasius’s Creed, and the Ten Commandments,—with
the Cardinal Virtues and the Apostolic Faith sticking
out of every corner of their dress, and angling for the applause or
contempt of the multitude. A full-dressed ecclesiastic is a sort of
go-cart of divinity; an ethical automaton. A clerical prig is, in
general, a very dangerous as well as contemptible character. The
utmost that those who thus habitually confound their opinions and
sentiments with the outside coverings of their bodies can aspire to,
is a negative and neutral character, like wax-work figures, where
the dress is done as much to the life as the man, and where both
are respectable pieces of pasteboard, or harmless compositions of
fleecy hosiery.</p>

<p class='c010'>The bane of all religions has been the necessity (real or supposed)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>of keeping up an attention and attaching a value to external forms
and ceremonies. It was, of course, much easier to conform to these,
or to manifest a reverence for them, than to practise the virtues or
understand the doctrines of true religion, of which they were merely
the outward types and symbols. The consequence has been, that
the greatest stress has been perpetually laid on what was of the least
value, and most easily professed. The form of religion has superseded
the substance; the means have supplanted the end; and the sterling
coin of charity and good works has been driven out of the currency,
for the base counterfeits of superstition and intolerance, by all the
money-changers and dealers in the temples established to religion
throughout the world. Vestments and chalices have been multiplied
for the reception of the Holy Spirit; the tagged points of controversy
and lackered varnish of hypocrisy have eaten into the solid
substance and texture of piety; ‘and all the inward acts of worship,
issuing from the native strength of the soul, run out (as Milton
expresses it) lavishly to the upper skin, and there harden into the
crust of formality.’ Hence we have had such shoals of</p>

<p class='c013'>who have foisted their ‘idiot and embryo’ inventions upon us for
truth, and who have fomented all the bad passions of the heart, and
let loose all the mischiefs of war, of fire, and famine, to avenge the
slightest difference of opinion on any one iota of their lying creeds,
or the slightest disrespect to any one of those mummeries and idle
pageants which they had set up as sacred idols for the world to
wonder at. We do not forget, in making these remarks, that there
was a time when the persons who will be most annoyed and
scandalized at them, would have taken a more effectual mode of
shewing their zeal and indignation; when to have expressed a free
opinion on a Monk’s cowl or a Cardinal’s hat, would have exposed
the writer who had been guilty of such sacrilege, to the pains and
penalties of excommunication; to be burnt at an <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">auto da fe</span></i>; to be
consigned to the dungeons of the Inquisition, or doomed to the
mines of Spanish America; to have his nose slit, or his ears cut off,
or his hand reduced to a stump. Such were the considerate and
humane proceedings by which the Priests of former times vindicated
their own honour, which they pretended to be the honour of God.
Such was their humility, when they had the power. Will they
complain now, if we only criticise the colour of a coat, or smile at
the circumference of a Doctor of Divinity’s wig, since we can do it
with impunity? We cry them mercy!</p>

<p class='c013'>Many people seem to think, that the restraints imposed on the
Clergy by the nature of their profession, take away from them,
by degrees, all temptations to violate the limits of duty, and that the
character grows to the cloth. We are afraid that this is not
altogether the case.</p>

<p class='c010'>How little can be done in the way of extracting virtues or intellect
from a piece of broad-cloth or a beaver hat, we have an instance in
the Quakers, who are the most remarkable, and the most unexceptionable
class of professors in this kind. They bear the same relation to
genuine characters, not brought up in the trammels of dress and
custom, that a clipped yew-tree, cut into the form of a peacock or
an armchair, does to the natural growth of a tree in the forest, left to
its own energies and luxuriance. The Quakers are docked into
form, but they have no spirit left. They are without ideas, except in
trade; without vices or virtues, unless we admit among the latter
those which we give as a character to servants when we turn them
away, viz. ‘that they are cleanly, sober, and honest.’ The Quaker
is, in short, a negative character, but it is the best that can be formed
in this mechanical way. The Priest is not a negative character; he
is something positive and disagreeable. He is not, like the Quaker,
distinguished from others merely by singularity of dress and manner,
but he is distinguished from others by pretensions to superiority over
them. His faults arise from his boasted exemption from the opposite
vices; and he has one vice running through all his others—hypocrisy.
He is proud, with an affectation of humility; bigotted, from a pretended
zeal for truth; greedy, with an ostentation of entire contempt
for the things of this world; professing self-denial, and always thinking
of self-gratification; censorious, and blind to his own faults; intolerant,
unrelenting, impatient of opposition, insolent to those below, and
cringing to those above him, with nothing but Christian meekness and
brotherly love in his mouth. He thinks more of external appearances
than of his internal convictions. He is tied down to the opinions
and prejudices of the world in every way. The motives of the heart
are clogged and checked at the outset, by the fear of idle censure;
his understanding is the slave of established creeds and formulas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>of faith. He can neither act, feel, or think for himself, or from
genuine impulse. He plays a part through life. He is an actor upon
a stage. The public are a spy upon him, and he wears a mask the
better to deceive them. If in this sort of theatrical assumption of
character he makes one false step, it may be fatal to him, and he
is induced to have recourse to the most unmanly arts to conceal it,
if possible. As he cannot be armed at all points against the flesh
and the devil, he takes refuge in self-delusion and mental imposture;
learns to play at fast and loose with his own conscience, and to
baffle the vigilance of the public by dexterous equivocations; sails
as near the wind as he can, shuffles with principle, is punctilious in
matters of form, and tries to reconcile the greatest strictness of
decorum and regularity of demeanour with the least possible sacrifice
of his own interest or appetites. Parsons are not drunkards,
because it is a vice that is easily detected and immediately offensive;
but they are great eaters, which is no less injurious to the health and
intellect. They indulge in all the sensuality that is not prohibited
in the Decalogue: they monopolize every convenience they can lay
lawful hands on: and consider themselves as the peculiar favourites of
Heaven, and the rightful inheritors of the earth. They are on a
short allowance of sin; and are only the more eager to catch at all
the stray bits and nice morsels they can meet. They are always
considering how they shall indemnify themselves in smaller things,
for their grudging self-denial in greater ones. Satan lies in wait
for them in a pinch of snuff, in a plate of buttered toast, or the
kidney end of a loin of veal. They lead their cooks the devil of a
life. Their dinner is the principal event of the day. They say
a long grace over it, partly to prolong the pleasure of expectation,
and to keep others waiting. They are appealed to as the most
competent judges, as arbiters <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">deliciarum</span></i> in all questions of the palate.
Their whole thoughts are taken up in pampering the flesh, and
comforting the spirit with all the little debasing luxuries which do
not come under the sentence of damnation, or breed scandal in the
parish. You find out their true character in those of them who
have quitted the cloth, and think it no longer necessary to practise
the same caution or disguise. You there find the dogmatism of the
divine ingrafted on the most lax speculations of the philosophical
freethinker, and the most romantic professions of universal benevolence
made a cover to the most unfeeling and unblushing spirit of selfishness.
The mask is taken off, but the character was the same under a more
jealous attention to appearances. With respect to one vice from
which the Clergy are bound to keep themselves clear, St. Paul has
observed, that <em>it is better to marry than burn</em>. ‘Continents,’ says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Hobbes, ‘have more of what they contain than other things.’ The
Clergy are men: and many of them, who keep a sufficient guard over
their conduct, are too apt, from a common law of our nature, to let
their thoughts and desires wander to forbidden ground. This is not
so well. It is not so well to be always thinking of the peccadillos
they cannot commit: to be hankering after the fleshpots of Egypt:
to have the charms of illicit gratification enhanced by privations, to
which others are not liable; to have the fancy always prurient, and
the imagination always taking a direction which they themselves
cannot follow.</p>

      <div class='line'>With meditations lawful?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But the mind of the Divine and Moralist by profession is a sort of
sanctuary for such thoughts. He is bound by his office to be always
detecting and pointing out abuses, to describe and conceive of them
in the strongest colours, to denounce and to abhor vice in others, to
be familiar with the diseases of the mind, as the physician is with
those of the body. But that this sort of speculative familiarity with
vice leads to a proportionable disgust at it, may be made a question.
The virtue of prudes has been thought doubtful: the morality of
priests, even of those who lead the most regular lives, is not, perhaps,
always ‘pure in the last recesses of the mind.’ They are obliged, as
it were, to have the odious nature of sin habitually in their thoughts,
and in their mouths; to wink, to make wry faces at it, to keep themselves
in a state of incessant indignation against it. It is like living
next door to a brothel, a situation which produces a great degree of
irritation against vice, and an eloquent abuse of those who are known
to practise it, but is not equally favourable to the growth and
cultivation of sentiments of virtue. To keep theoretical watch and
ward over vice, to be systematic spies and informers against immorality,
‘while <em>they</em> the supervisors grossly gape on,’ is hardly
decent. It is almost as bad as belonging to the Society for the
Suppression of Vice—a Society which appears to have had its
origin in much the same feeling as the monkish practice of auricular
confession in former times.—Persons who undertake to pry into,
or cleanse out all the filth of a common sewer, either cannot have
very nice noses, or will soon lose them. Swift used to say, that
people of the nicest imaginations have the dirtiest ideas. The virtues
of the priesthood are not the virtues of humanity. They are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>honest, cordial, unaffected, and sincere. They are the mask, not
the man. There is always the feeling of something hollow, assuming,
and disagreeable, in them. There is something in the profession that
does not sit easy on the imagination. You are not at home with it.
Do you, or do you not, seek the society of a man for being a Parson?
You would as soon think of marrying a woman for being an old
maid!</p>

<p class='c010'>To proceed to what we at first proposed, which was a consideration
of the Clerical Character, less in connexion with private morality
than with public principle. We have already spoken of the Dissenting
Clergy as, in this respect, an honest and exemplary body of
men. They are so by the supposition, in what relates to matters of
opinion. The Established Clergy of any religion certainly are not
so, by the same self-evident rule; on the contrary, they are bound
to conform their professions of religious belief to a certain popular and
lucrative standard, and bound over to keep the peace by certain
articles of faith. It is a rare felicity in any one who gives his
attention fairly and freely to the subject, and has read the Scriptures,
the Misnah, and the Talmud—the Fathers, the Schoolmen, the
Socinian Divines, the Lutheran and Calvinistic controversy, with
innumerable volumes appertaining thereto and illustrative thereof, to
believe all the Thirty-nine Articles, ‘except one.’ If those who
are destined for the episcopal office exercise their understandings
honestly and openly upon every one of these questions, how little
chance is there that they should come to the same conclusion upon
them all? If they do not inquire, what becomes of their independence
of understanding? If they conform to what they do not
believe, what becomes of their honesty? Their estimation in the
world, as well as their livelihood, depends on their tamely submitting
their understanding to authority at first, and on their not seeing reason
to alter their opinion afterwards. Is it likely that a man will intrepidly
open his eyes to conviction, when he sees poverty and
disgrace staring him in the face as the inevitable consequence? Is it
likely, after the labours of a whole life of servility and cowardice—after
repeating daily what he does not understand, and what those
who require him to repeat it do not believe, or pretend to believe,
and impose on others only as a ready test of insincerity, and a compendious
shibboleth of want of principle: after doing morning and
evening service to the God of this world—after keeping his lips
sealed against the indiscreet mention of the plainest truths, and
opening them only to utter mental reservations—after breakfasting,
dining, and supping, waking and sleeping, being clothed and fed,
upon a collusion,—after saying a double grace and washing his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>hands after dinner, and preparing for a course of smutty jests to make
himself good company,—after nodding to Deans, bowing to Bishops,
waiting upon Lords, following in the train of Heads of Colleges,
watching the gracious eye of those who have presentations in their
gift, and the lank cheek of those who are their present incumbents,—after
finding favour, patronage, promotion, prizes, praise, promises,
smiles, squeezes of the hand, invitations to tea and cards with the
ladies, the epithets, ‘a charming man,’ ‘an agreeable creature,’ ‘a
most respectable character,’ the certainty of reward, and the hopes of
glory, always proportioned to the systematic baseness of his compliance
with the will of his superiors, and the sacrifice of every
particle of independence, or pretence to manly spirit and honesty of
character,—is it likely, that a man so tutored and trammelled, and
inured to be his own dupe, and the tool of others, will ever, in one
instance out of thousands, attempt to burst the cobweb fetters which
bind him in the magic circle of contradictions and enigmas, or risk
the independence of his fortune for the independence of his mind?
<em>Principle</em> is a word that is not to be found in the Young Clergyman’s
Best Companion: it is a thing he has no idea of, except as something
pragmatical, sour, puritanical, and Presbyterian. To oblige is his
object, not to offend. He wishes ‘to be conformed to this world,
rather than transformed.’ He expects one day to be a Court-divine,
a dignitary of the Church, an ornament to the State; and he knows
all the texts of Scripture, which, tacked to a visitation, an assize, or
corporation-dinner sermon, will float him gently, ‘like little wanton
boys that swim on bladders,’ up to the palace at Lambeth. A hungry
poet, gaping for solid pudding or empty praise, may easily be supposed
to set about a conscientious revision and change of his unpopular
opinions, from the reasonable prospect of a place or pension, and to
eat his words the less scrupulously, the longer he has had nothing
else to eat. A snug, promising, soft, smiling, orthodox Divine, who
has a living attached to the cure of souls, and whose sentiments are
beneficed, who has a critical <em>bonus</em> for finding out that all the books
he cannot understand are written against the Christian Religion, and
founds the doctrine of the Trinity, and his hopes of a Bishopric, on
the ignorant construction of a Greek particle, cannot be expected to
change the opinions to which he has formerly subscribed his belief,
with the revolutions of the sun or the changes of the moon. His
political, as well as religious creed, is installed in hopes, pampered in
expectations; and the longer he winks and shuts his eyes and holds
them close, catching only under their drooping lids ‘glimpses that
may make him less forlorn,’ day-dreams of lawn-sleeves, and nightly
beatific visions of episcopal mitres, the less disposed will he be to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>open them to the broad light of reason, or to forsake the primrose
path of preferment, to tear and mangle his sleek tender-skinned
conscience, dipped and softened in the milk-bath of clerical complaisance,
among the thorns and briars of controversial divinity, or to
get out on the other side upon a dark and dreary waste, amidst a
crew of hereticks and schismatics, and Unitarian dealers in ‘potential
infidelity’—</p>

<p class='c013'>This were too much to expect from the chaplain of an Archbishop.</p>

<p class='c010'>Take one illustration of the truth of all that has been here said,
and of more that might be said upon the subject. It is related in
that valuable comment on the present reign and the existing order of
things, Bishop Watson’s Life, that the late Dr. Paley having at one
time to maintain a thesis in the University, proposed to the Bishop,
for his approbation, the following:—‘That the eternity of Hell
torments is contradictory to the goodness of God.’ The Bishop
observed, that he thought this a bold doctrine to maintain in the face
of the Church; but Paley persisted in his determination. Soon
after, however, having sounded the opinions of certain persons, high
in authority, and well read in the orthodoxy of preferment, he came
back in great alarm, said he found the thing would not do, and
begged, instead of his first thesis, to have the reverse one substituted
in its stead, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>—‘That the Eternity of Hell torments is not contradictory
to the goodness of God.’—What burning day-light is here
thrown on clerical discipline, and the bias of a University education!
This passage is worth all Mosheim’s Ecclesiastical History, Wood’s
Athenæ Oxonienses, and Mr. Coleridge’s two Lay Sermons. This
same shuffling Divine is the same Dr. Paley, who afterwards employed
the whole of his life, and his moderate second-hand abilities,
in tampering with religion, morality, and politics,—in trimming
between his convenience and his conscience,—in crawling between
heaven and earth, and trying to cajole both. His celebrated and
popular work on Moral Philosophy, is celebrated and popular for no
other reason, than that it is a somewhat ingenious and amusing
apology for existing abuses of every description, by which any thing
is to be got. It is a very elaborate and consolatory elucidation of
the text, <em>that men should not quarrel with their bread and butter</em>. It is
not an attempt to show what is right, but to palliate and find out
plausible excuses for what is wrong. It is a work without the least
value, except as a convenient common-place book or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vade mecum</span></i>, for
tyro politicians and young divines, to smooth their progress in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Church or the State. This work is a text-book in the University:
its morality is the acknowledged morality of the House of Commons.
The Lords are above it. They do not affect that sort of casuistry,
by which the country gentlemen contrive to oblige the Ministers, and
to reconcile themselves to their constituents.</p>

<p class='c013'>This then is the secret of the alliance between Church and State—make
a man a tool and a hypocrite in one respect and he will make
himself a slave and a pander in every other, that you can make it
worth his while. Those who make a regular traffic of their belief
in religion, will not be backward to compromise their sentiments in
what relates to the concerns between man and man. He who is in
the habit of affronting his Maker with solemn mockeries of faith, as
the means of a creditable livelihood, will not bear the testimony of a
good conscience before men, if he finds it a losing concern. The
principle of integrity is gone; the patriotism of the religious sycophant
is rotten at the core. Hence we find that the Established Clergy of
all religions have been the most devoted tools of power. Priestcraft
and Despotism have gone hand in hand—have stood and fallen together.
It is this that makes them so fond and loving; so pious and
so loyal; so ready to play the Court-game into one another’s hands,
and so firmly knit and leagued together against the rights and liberties
of mankind. Thus Mr. Southey sings in laureat strains:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘One fate attends the altar and the throne.’</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Yet the same peremptory versifier qualifies the Church of Rome with

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The same that is, that was, and is to be,’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>without giving us to understand whether in Popish countries, the best
and most ‘single-hearted’ portion of Europe, the same lofty and
abstracted doctrine holds good. This uncivil laureat has indeed gone
so far in one of his ‘songs of delight and rustical roundelays,’ as to
give the Princess Charlotte the following critical advice:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Bear thou that great Eliza in thy mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who from a wreck this fabric edified,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>And her who, to a nation’s voice resigned,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>When Rome in hope her wiliest engines plied,</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Stood up against the Father whom she lov’d</span>.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>These lines seem to glance at contingent rebellion, at speculative
treason: they have a squint, a strong cast of the eye, that way.
But it is neither our business nor inclination to point out passages in
prose or verse, for the animadversion of the Attorney-General. Mr.
Croker, we fear, however, must have been greatly scandalised at this
specimen of his friend’s original mode of thinking for himself in such
delicate matters as the cashiering of Kings and encouraging their
daughters, as in duty bound, to stand up against them whenever Mr.
Southey pleases. <em>Launce</em> could not have been put more to it when
his dog misbehaved ‘among the gentlemanlike dogs at the Duke’s
table,’ than the Admiralty Secretary at this faux-pas of Mr. Southey’s
reformed Jacobin Muse. It was shewing the lady’s breeding to
some purpose. This gratuitous piece of advice to a Protestant
Princess is, however, just the reverse of that which Cardinal Wolsey
gave to a Popish ruler of these realms, Henry <span class='fss'>VIII.</span>, before that
Monarch saw reason to change his religious principles for a wife, as
Mr. Southey has changed his political ones for a pension. The
Cardinal was almost as wise a man in his generation as Mr. Southey
is in his; saw as far into reasons of state, and charged by anticipation
all the evils of anarchy and rebellion since his time on that very
Protestant religion, which the modern courtier under the Protestant
succession considers as the only support of passive obedience and
non-resistance. Cavendish, in his Memoirs, in the Harleian Miscellany,
makes Wolsey on his death-bed give this testamentary
advice to his Sovereign:—‘And, Master Kingston, I desire you
further to request his Grace, in God’s name, that he have a vigilant
eye to suppress the hellish Lutherans, that they increase not through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>his great negligence, in such a sort as to be compelled to take up
arms to subdue them, as the King of Bohemia was; whose commons
being infected with Wickliff’s heresies, the King was forced to take
that course. Let him consider the story of King Richard the
Second, the second son of his progenitor, who lived in the time of
Wickliff’s seditions and heresies: did not the commons, I pray you,
in his time, rise against the nobility and chief governors of this realm;
and at the last, some of them were put to death without justice or
mercy? And, under pretence of having all things common, did they
not fall to spoiling and robbing, and at last took the King’s person,
and carried him about the city, making him obedient to their
proclamations?’—[The author of <cite>Wat Tyler</cite> has given a very different
version of this story.]—‘Did not also the traitorous heretick,
Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, pitch a field with hereticks
against King Henry the Fourth, where the King was in person, and
fought against them, to whom God gave the victory? Alas! if
these be not plain precedents and sufficient persuasions to admonish
a Prince, then God will take away from us our present rulers, and
leave us to the hands of our enemies. And then will ensue mischief
upon mischief, inconveniences, barrenness, and scarcity, for want of
good orders in the commonwealth, from which God of his tender
mercy defend us.’—<cite>Harleian Miscell.</cite> vol. iv. p. 556.</p>

<p class='c010'>The dying Cardinal might here be supposed to have foreseen the
grand Rebellion, the glorious Revolution of 1688, the expulsion of
the Stuarts, and the Protestant ascendancy, the American and the
French Revolutions—as all growing out of Wickliff’s heresy, and
the doctrines of the hellish Lutherans. Our laurel-honouring laureat
cannot see all this after it has happened. Wolsey was a prophet;
he is only a poet. Wolsey knew (and so would any man but a poet),
that to allow men freedom of opinion in matters of religion, was to
make them free in all other things. Mr. Southey, who raves in
favour of the Bourbons and against the Pope, is ‘blind with double
darkness.’ He will assuredly never find that ‘single-heartedness’
which he seeks, but in the bosom of the Church of Rome.</p>

<p class='c010'>One mischief of this alliance between Church and State (which
the old-fashioned Statesman understood so thoroughly and the modern
sciolist only by halves) is, that it is tacit and covert. The Church
does not profess to take any active share in affairs of State, and by
this means is able to forward all the designs of indirect and crooked
policy more effectually and without suspicion. The garb of religion
is the best cloak for power. There is nothing so much to be guarded
against as the wolf in sheep’s clothing. The Clergy pretend to be
neutral in all such matters, not to meddle with politics. But that is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>and always must be, a false pretence. <em>Those that are not with us, are
against us</em>, is a maxim that always holds true. These pious pastors
of the people and accomplices of the government make use of their
heavenly calling and demure professions of meekness and humility,
as an excuse for never committing themselves on the side of the
people: but the same sacred and spiritual character, not to be sullied
by mixing with worldly concerns, does not hinder them from employing
all their arts and influence on the side of power and of their own
interest. Their religion is incompatible with a common regard to
justice or humanity; but it is compatible with an excess of courtly
zeal. The officiating Clergyman at Derby the other day pestered
Brandreth to death with importunities to inform against his associates,
but put his hand before his mouth when he offered to say what he
knew of Oliver, the Government-spy. This is not exactly as it
should be; but it cannot be otherwise than it is. Priests are
naturally favourers of power, inasmuch as they are dependent on it.—Their
power over the mind is hardly sufficient of itself to insure
absolute obedience to their authority, without a reinforcement of
power over the body. The secular arm must come in aid of the
spiritual. The law is necessary to compel the payment of tythes.
Kings and conquerors make laws, parcel out lands, and erect
churches and palaces for the priests and dignitaries of religion:
‘they will have them to shew their mitred fronts in Courts and
Parliaments’; and in return, Priests anoint Kings with holy oil,
hedge them round with inviolability, spread over them the mysterious
sanctity of religion, and, with very little ceremony, make over the
whole species as slaves to these Gods upon earth by virtue of divine
right! This is no losing trade. It aggrandizes those who are
concerned in it, and is death to the rest of the world. It is a
solemn league and covenant fully ratified and strictly carried into
effect, to the very letter, in all countries, Pagan, Mahommedan, and
Christian,—except this. It is time to put an end to it everywhere.
But those who are pledged to its support, and ‘by this craft have
their wealth,’ have unfortunately remained of one opinion, quite
‘single-hearted’ from the beginning of the world: those who, like
Mr. Southey, are for separating the Man of Sin from the Scarlet
Whore, change their opinions once every five and twenty years. Need
we wonder at the final results? Kings and priests are not such coxcombs
or triflers as poets and philosophers. The two last are always
squabbling about their share of reputation; the two first amicably
divide the spoil. It is the opinion, we understand, of an eminent poet
and a minute philosopher of the present day, that the press ought to
be shackled,—severely shackled; and particularly that the <cite>Edinburgh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Review</cite>, the <cite>Examiner</cite>, and the <cite>Yellow Dwarf</cite>, as full of <cite>Examinerisms</cite>,
ought to be instantly put down. Another poet or philosopher, who
has not been so severely handled in these works, thinks differently;
and so do we. Nay, Mr. —— himself has been a long time in
coming to this opinion; and no wonder, for he had a long way to
come in order to arrive at it. But all the Kings that ever were,
and ninety-nine out of a hundred of all the Priests that surround them,
jump at this conclusion concerning the fatal consequences of the
Liberty of the Press—by instinct. We have never yet seen
that greatest calamity that can befal mankind, deprecated by Mr.
Burke, namely, literary men acting in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps</span></i>, and making common
cause for the benefit of mankind, as another description of persons
act in concert and make common cause against them. He himself
was an instance how little need be dreaded in this way. If the
National Assembly had sent for Burke over, to assist in framing
a Constitution for them, this traitor to liberty and apostate from
principle, instead of loading the French Revolution with every
epithet of obloquy and execration which his irritable vanity and
mercenary malice could invent, would have extolled it to the skies,
as the highest monument of human happiness and wisdom. But the
genius of philosophy, as he said, is not yet known. It is a subject
which we shall shortly endeavour to make clear.</p>

<p class='c010'>In another point of view, Priests are a sort of women in the State,
and naturally subject to the higher powers. The Church has no
means of temporal advancement but through the interest and countenance
of the State. It receives what the other is pleased to allow it
as a mark of friendship, out of the public purse. The Clergy do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>engage in active or lucrative professions: they are occupied with praise
and prayer and the salvation of souls—with heaping up for themselves
treasures in heaven, and wrath upon their enemies’ heads against the
day of judgment. The candidate for Church preferment must therefore
look for it as a free gift at the hands of the great and powerful;
he must win his way to wealth and honours by ‘the sufferance of
supernal power.’ The Church can only hope for a comfortable
establishment in the world by finding favour, as a handmaid, in the
eye of the State: the Church must wed the State, both for protection
and a maintenance. The preacher of God’s word looks for his
reward in heaven, but he must live in the mean time. But he is
precluded by his cloth and his spiritual avocations from getting on in
the world by the usual means of interest or ambition. His only hope
of advancement lies in the Bishop’s blessing and his patron’s smile.
These may in time translate him to a vacant diocese of 10,000<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> a
year. His labours in the cure of souls, or the settling the most
difficult point of controversial divinity, would not, on an average
calculation, bring him in a 100<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> Parson Adams could not dispose
of his manuscript sermons to the booksellers; and he ruined his hopes
of preferment with Lady Booby, by refusing to turn pimp. Finally,
the Clergy are lovers of abstract power, for they are themselves the
representatives of almighty power: they are ambassadors of religion,
delegates of heaven. The authority under which they act is not
always respected so readily, cordially, and implicitly, as it ought to
be, and they are indignant at the neglect. They become tetchy and
imperious, and mingle the irritability of self-love with their zeal for
the honour of God. They are not backward to call for fire from
heaven, and to put down the Atheist and the Schismatic by the
strong hand of power. <em>Fear God and honour the King</em>, is the motto
of priestcraft; but it is not a sound logical dilemma, for this reason,
that God is always the same; but Kings are of all sorts, good, bad,
or indifferent—wise, or mad, or foolish—arbitrary tyrants, or constitutional
Monarchs, like our own. The rule is absolute in the first
case, not in the second. But the Clergy, by a natural infirmity, are
disposed to force the two into a common analogy. They are servants
of God by profession, and sycophants of power from necessity.
They delight to look up with awe to Kings, as to another Providence.
It was a Bishop, in the reign of James <span class='fss'>I.</span> who drew a parallel between
‘their divine and sacred Majesties,’ meaning the pitiful tyrant whom
he served, and God Almighty: yet the Attorney-General of that
day did not prosecute him for blasphemy. The Clergy fear God
more than they love him. They think more of his power than
of his wisdom or goodness. They would make Kings Gods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>upon earth; and as they cannot clothe them with the wisdom
or beneficence of the Deity, would arm them with his power at
any rate.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c011'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>—And who are you that ask the question? One of the people.
And yet you would be something! Then you would not have the
People nothing. For what is the People? Millions of men, like
you, with hearts beating in their bosoms, with thoughts stirring in
their minds, with the blood circulating in their veins, with wants and
appetites, and passions and anxious cares, and busy purposes and
affections for others and a respect for themselves, and a desire of
happiness, and a right to freedom, and a will to be free. And yet
you would tear out this mighty heart of a nation, and lay it bare and
bleeding at the foot of despotism: you would slay the mind of a
country to fill up the dreary aching void with the old, obscene,
drivelling prejudices of superstition and tyranny: you would tread out
the eye of Liberty (the light of nations) like ‘a vile jelly,’ that mankind
may be led about darkling to its endless drudgery, like the
Hebrew Sampson (shorn of his strength and blind), by his insulting
taskmasters: you would make the throne every thing, and the people
nothing, to be yourself less than nothing, a very slave, a reptile, a
creeping, cringing sycophant, a court favourite, a pander to Legitimacy—that
detestable fiction, which would make you and me and all
mankind its slaves or victims; which would, of right and with all the
sanctions of religion and morality, sacrifice the lives of millions to the
least of its caprices; which subjects the rights, the happiness, and
liberty of nations, to the will of some of the lowest of the species;
which rears its bloated hideous form to brave the will of a whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>people; that claims mankind as its property, and allows human nature
to exist only upon sufferance; that haunts the understanding like a
frightful spectre, and oppresses the very air with a weight that is not
to be borne; that like a witch’s spell covers the earth with a dim and
envious mist, and makes us turn our eyes from the light of heaven,
which we have no right to look at without its leave: robs us of ‘the
unbought grace of life,’ the pure delight and conscious pride in works
of art or nature; leaves us no thought or feeling that we dare call our
own; makes genius its lacquey, and virtue its easy prey; sports with
human happiness, and mocks at human misery; suspends the breath
of liberty, and almost of life; exenterates us of our affections, blinds
our understandings, debases our imaginations, converts the very hope
of emancipation from its yoke into sacrilege, binds the successive
countless generations of men together in its chains like a string of
felons or galley-slaves, lest they should ‘resemble the flies of a
summer,’ considers any remission of its absolute claims as a gracious
boon, an act of royal clemency and favour, and confounds all sense of
justice, reason, truth, liberty, humanity, in one low servile death-like
dread of power without limit and without remorse!<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c011'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Such is the old doctrine of Divine Right, new-vamped up under
the style and title of Legitimacy. ‘Fine word, Legitimate!’ We
wonder where our English politicians picked it up. Is it an echo
from the tomb of the martyred monarch, Charles the First? Or was
it the last word which his son, James the Second, left behind him
in his flight, and bequeathed with his <em>abdication</em>, to his legitimate
successors? It is not written in our annals in the years 1688, in
1715, or 1745. It was not sterling then, which was only fifteen
years before his present Majesty’s accession to the throne. Has it
become so since? Is the Revolution of 1688 at length acknowledged
to be a blot in the family escutcheon of the Prince of Orange or the
Elector of Hanover? Is the choice of the people, which raised them
to the throne, found to be the only flaw in their title to the succession;
the weight of royal gratitude growing more uneasy with the distance
of the obligation? Is the alloy of liberty, mixed up with it, thought
to debase that <em>fine carat</em>, which should compose the regal diadem?
Are the fire-new specimens of the principles of the Right-Liners, and
of Sir Robert Filmer’s patriarchal scheme, to be met with in <cite>The
Courier</cite>, <cite>The Day</cite>, <cite>The Sun</cite>, and some time back, in <cite>The Times</cite>, handed
about to be admired in the highest circle, like the new gold coinage
of sovereigns and half-sovereigns? We do not know. It may seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>to be <em>Latter Lammas</em> with the doctrine at this time of day; but better
late than never. By taking root in the soil of France, from which
it was expelled (not quite so long as from our own), it may in
time stretch out its feelers and strong suckers to this country; and
present an altogether curious and novel aspect, by ingrafting the
principles of the House of Stuart on the illustrious stock of the
House of Brunswick.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>What then is the People? We will answer first, by saying what
it is not; and this we cannot do better than in the words of a certain
author, whose testimony on the subject is too important not to avail
ourselves of it again in this place. That infatuated drudge of
despotism, who at one moment asks, ‘Where is the madman that
maintains the doctrine of divine right?’ and the next affirms, that
‘Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span> has the same right to the throne of France,
independently of his merits or conduct, that Mr. Coke of Norfolk
has to his estate at Holkham,’<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a> has given us a tolerable clue to
what we have to expect from that mild paternal sway to which he
would so kindly make us and the rest of the world over, in hopeless
perpetuity. In a violent philippic against the author of the <cite>Political
Register</cite>, he thus inadvertently expresses himself:—‘Mr. Cobbett
had been sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for a libel, and during
the time that he was in Newgate, it was discovered that he had been in
treaty with Government to avoid the sentence passed upon him; and
that he had proposed to certain of the agents of Ministers, that if they
would let him off, they might make what future use they pleased of
him; <em>he would entirely betray the cause of the people</em>; he would either
write or not write, or <em>write against them</em>, as he had once done before,
just as Ministers thought proper. To this, however, it was replied,
that ‘Cobbett had written on too many sides already <em>to be worth a
groat for the service of Government</em>‘; and he accordingly suffered his
confinement!’—We here then see plainly enough what it is that,
in the opinion of this very competent judge, alone renders any
writer ‘worth a groat for the service of Government,’ <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> that he
shall be able and willing entirely to betray the cause of the people.
It follows from this principle (by which he seems to estimate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>value of his lucubrations in the service of Government—we do not
know whether the Government judge of them in the same way),
that the cause of the people and the cause of the Government, who
are represented as thus anxious to suborn their creatures to write
against the people, are not the same but the reverse of one another.
This slip of the pen in our professional retainer of legitimacy, though
a libel on our own Government, is, notwithstanding, a general philosophic
truth (the only one he ever hit upon), and an axiom in
political mechanics, which we shall make the text of the following
commentary.</p>

<p class='c010'>What are the interests of the people? Not the interests of those
who would betray them. Who is to judge of those interests? Not
those who would suborn others to betray them. That Government
is instituted for the benefit of the governed, there can be little doubt;
but the interests of the Government (when once it becomes absolute
and independent of the people) must be directly at variance with
those of the governed. The interests of the one are common and
equal rights: of the other, exclusive and invidious privileges. The
essence of the first is to be shared alike by all, and to benefit the
community in proportion as they are spread: the essence of the last
is to be destroyed by communication, and to subsist only—in wrong
of the people. Rights and privileges are a contradiction in terms:
for if one has more than his right, others must have less. The
latter are the deadly nightshade of the commonwealth, near which no
wholesome plant can thrive,—the ivy clinging round the trunk of the
British oak, blighting its verdure, drying up its sap, and oppressing
its stately growth. The insufficient checks and balances opposed to
the overbearing influence of hereditary rank and power in our own
Constitution, and in every Government which retains the least trace
of freedom, are so many illustrations of this principle, if it needed
any. The tendency in arbitrary power to encroach upon the liberties
and comforts of the people, and to convert the public good into a
stalking-horse to its own pride and avarice, has never (that we know)
been denied by any one but ‘the professional gentleman,’ who writes
in <cite>The Day and New Times</cite>. The great and powerful, in order to be
what they aspire to be, and what this gentleman would have them,
perfectly independent of the will of the people, ought also to be
perfectly independent of the assistance of the people. To be formally
invested with the attributes of Gods upon earth, they ought first to be
raised above its petty wants and appetites: they ought to give proofs
of the beneficence and wisdom of Gods, before they can be trusted
with the power. When we find them seated above the world,
sympathizing with the welfare, but not feeling the passions of men,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>receiving neither good nor hurt, neither tilth nor tythe from them,
but bestowing their benefits as free gifts on all, they may then be
expected, but not till then, to rule over us like another Providence.
We may make them a present of all the taxes they do not apply to
their own use: they are perfectly welcome to all the power, to the
possession of which they are perfectly indifferent, and to the abuse of
which they can have no possible temptation. But Legitimate Governments
(flatter them as we will) are not another Heathen mythology.
They are neither so cheap nor so splendid as the Delphin edition of
Ovid’s Metamorphoses. They are indeed ‘Gods to punish,’ but in
other respects ‘men of our infirmity.’ They do not feed on ambrosia
or drink nectar; but live on the common fruits of the earth, of
which they get the largest share, and the best. The wine they drink
is made of grapes: the blood they shed is that of their subjects: the
laws they make are not against themselves: the taxes they vote, they
afterwards devour. They have the same wants that we have: and
having the option, very naturally help themselves first, out of the
common stock, without thinking that others are to come after them.
With the same natural necessities, they have a thousand artificial
ones besides; and with a thousand times the means to gratify them,
they are still voracious, importunate, unsatisfied. Our State-paupers
have their hands in every man’s dish, and fare sumptuously every
day. They live in palaces, and loll in coaches. In spite of Mr.
Malthus, their studs of horses consume the produce of our fields, their
dog-kennels are glutted with the food which would maintain the
children of the poor. They cost us so much a year in dress and
furniture, so much in stars and garters, blue ribbons, and grand
crosses,—so much in dinners, breakfasts, and suppers, and so much
in suppers, breakfasts, and dinners.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c011'><sup>[47]</sup></a> These heroes of the Income-tax,
Worthies of the Civil List, Saints of the Court calendar
(<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Compagnons du Lys</span></i>), have their naturals and non-naturals, like the
rest of the world, but at a dearer rate. They are real <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i>
personages, and do not live upon air. You will find it easier to keep
them a week than a month; and at the end of that time, waking from
the sweet dream of Legitimacy, you may say with Caliban, ‘Why,
what a fool was I to take this drunken monster for a God!’ In
fact, the case on the part of the people is so far self-evident. There
is but a limited earth and a limited fertility to supply the demands
both of Government and people; and what the one gains in the
division of the spoil, beyond its average proportion, the other must
needs go without. Do you suppose that our gentlemen-placemen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>and pensioners would suffer so many wretches to be perishing in
our streets and highways, if they could relieve their extreme misery
without parting with any of their own superfluities? If the Government
take a fourth of the produce of the poor man’s labour, they will
be rich, and he will be in want. If they can contrive to take
one half of it by legal means, or by a stretch of arbitrary power,
they will be just twice as rich, twice as insolent and tyrannical,
and he will be twice as poor, twice as miserable and oppressed,
in a mathematical ratio to the end of the chapter, that is, till the
one can extort and the other endure no more. It is the same with
respect to power. The will and passions of the great are not
exerted in regulating the seasons, or rolling the planets round their
orbits for our good, without fee or reward, but in controlling the will
and passions of others, in making the follies and vices of mankind
subservient to their own, and marring,</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Because men suffer it, their toy, the world.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This is self-evident, like the former. Their will cannot be paramount,
while any one in the community, or the whole community
together, has the power to thwart it. A King cannot attain absolute
power, while the people remain perfectly free; yet what King
would not attain absolute power? While any trace of liberty is left
among a people, ambitious Princes will never be easy, never at peace,
never of sound mind; nor will they ever rest or leave one stone
unturned, till they have succeeded in destroying the very name of
liberty, or making it into a by-word, and in rooting out the germs of
every popular right and liberal principle from a soil once sacred to
liberty. It is not enough that they have secured the whole power of
the state in their hands,—that they carry every measure they please
without the chance of an effectual opposition to it: but a word
uttered against it is torture to their ears,—a thought that questions
their wanton exercise of the royal prerogative rankles in their breasts
like poison. Till all distinctions of right and wrong, liberty and
slavery, happiness and misery, are looked upon as matters of indifference,
or as saucy, insolent pretensions,—are sunk and merged in their
idle caprice and pampered self-will, they will still feel themselves
‘cribbed, confined, and cabin’d in’: but if they can once more set
up the doctrine of Legitimacy, ‘the right divine of Kings to govern
wrong,’ and set mankind at defiance with impunity, they will then be
‘broad and casing as the general air, whole as the rock.’ This is
the point from which they set out, and to which by the grace of God
and the help of man they may return again. Liberty is short and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>fleeting, a transient grace that lights upon the earth by stealth and at
long intervals—</p>

      <div class='line'>A moment white, then melts for ever.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But power is eternal; it is ‘enthroned in the hearts of Kings.’
If you want the proofs, look at history, look at geography, look
abroad; but do not look at home!</p>

<p class='c010'>The power of an arbitrary King or an aspiring Minister does not
increase with the liberty of the subject, but must be circumscribed by
it. It is aggrandized by perpetual, systematic, insidious, or violent
encroachments on popular freedom and natural right, as the sea gains
upon the land by swallowing it up.—What then can we expect from
the mild paternal sway of absolute power, and its sleek minions?
What the world has always received at its hands, an abuse of power
as vexatious, cowardly, and unrelenting, as the power itself was
unprincipled, preposterous, and unjust. They who get wealth and
power from the people, who drive them like cattle to slaughter or to
market, ‘and levy cruel wars, wasting the earth’; they who wallow
in luxury, while the people are ‘steeped in poverty to the very lips,’
and bowed to the earth with unremitting labour, can have but little
sympathy with those whose loss of liberty and property is their gain.
What is it that the wealth of thousands is composed of? The tears,
the sweat, and blood of millions. What is it that constitutes the
glory of the Sovereigns of the earth? To have millions of men
their slaves. Wherever the Government does not emanate (as in
our own excellent Constitution) from the people, the principle of the
Government, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i>, the point of honour, in all those
connected with it, and raised by it to privileges above the law and
above humanity, will be hatred to the people. Kings who would be
thought to reign in contempt of the people, will shew their contempt
of them in every act of their lives. Parliaments, not chosen by the
people, will only be the instruments of Kings, who do not reign in
the hearts of the people, ‘to betray the cause of the people.’
Ministers, not responsible to the people, will squeeze the last
shilling out of them. <em>Charity begins at home</em>, is a maxim as true of
Governments as of individuals. When the English Parliament
insisted on its right of taxing the Americans without their consent,
it was not from an apprehension that the Americans would, by being
left to themselves, lay such heavy duties on their own produce and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>manufactures, as would afflict the generosity of the mother-country,
and put the mild paternal sentiments of Lord North to the blush.
If any future King of England should keep a wistful eye on the map
of that country, it would rather be to hang it up as a trophy of
legitimacy, and to ‘punish the last successful example of a democratic
rebellion,’ than from any yearnings of fatherly good-will to the
American people, or from finding his ‘large heart’ and capacity for
good government, ‘confined in too narrow room’ in the united
kingdoms of Great Britain, Ireland, and Hanover. If Ferdinand
<span class='fss'>VII.</span> refuses the South American patriots leave to plant the olive or
the vine, throughout that vast continent, it is his pride, not his
humanity, that steels his royal resolution.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c011'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In 1781, the Controller-general of France, under Louis <span class='fss'>XVI.</span>
Monsieur Joli de Fleuri, defined the people of France to be <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un peuple
serf, corveable et baillable, à merci et misericorde</span></i>. When Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span>
as the Count de Lille, protested against his brother’s accepting the
Constitution of 1792 (he has since become an accepter of Constitutions
himself, if not an observer of them,) as compromising the rights and
privileges of the noblesse and clergy as well as of the crown, he was
right in considering the Bastile, or ‘King’s castle,’ with the
picturesque episode of the Man in the Iron Mask, the fifteen
thousand <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lettres de cachet</span></i>, issued in the mild reign of Louis <span class='fss'>XV.</span>,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corvées</span></i>, tythes, game-laws, holy water, the right of pillaging,
imprisoning, massacring, persecuting, harassing, insulting, and
ingeniously tormenting the minds and bodies of the whole French
people at every moment of their lives, on every possible pretence, and
without any check or control but their own mild paternal sentiments
towards them, as among the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">menus plaisirs</span></i>, the chief points of
etiquette, the immemorial privileges, and favourite amusements of
Kings, Priests, and Nobles, from the beginning to the end of time,
without which the bare title of King, Priest, or Noble, would not
have been worth a groat.</p>

<p class='c010'>The breasts of Kings and Courtiers then are not the safest depository
of the interests of the people. But they know best what is
for their good! Yes—to prevent it! The people may indeed feel
their grievance, but their betters, it is said, must apply the remedy—which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>they take good care never to do! If the people want judgment
in their own affairs (which is not certain, for they only meddle
with their own affairs when they are forcibly brought home to them
in a way which they can hardly misunderstand), this is at any rate
better than the want of sincerity, which would constantly and systematically
lead their superiors to betray those interests, from their having
other ends of their own to serve. It is better to trust to ignorance
than to malice—to run the risk of sometimes miscalculating the odds
than to play against loaded dice. The people would in this way
stand as little chance in defending their purses or their persons against
Mr. C—— or Lord C——, as an honest country gentleman would
have had in playing at put or hazard with Count Fathom or Jonathan
Wild. A certain degree of folly, or rashness, or indecision, or even
violence in attaining an object, is surely less to be dreaded than a
malignant, deliberate, mercenary intention in others to deprive us of
it. If the people must have attorneys, and the advice of counsel, let
them have attorneys and counsel of their own chusing, not those who
are employed by special retainer against them, or who regularly hire
others to <em>betray their cause</em>.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This then is the cause of the people, the good of the people, judged
of by common feeling and public opinion. Mr. Burke contemptuously
defines the people to be ‘any faction that at the time can get the
power of the sword into its hands.’ No: that may be a description
of the Government, but it is not of the people. The people is the
hand, heart, and head of the whole community acting to one purpose,
and with a mutual and thorough consent. The hand of the people
so employed to execute what the heart feels, and the head thinks,
must be employed more beneficially for the cause of the people, than
in executing any measures which the cold hearts, and contriving heads
of any faction, with distinct privileges and interests, may dictate to
betray their cause. The will of the people necessarily tends to the
general good as its end; and it must attain that end, and can only
attain it, in proportion as it is guided—First, by popular feeling, as
arising out of the immediate wants and wishes of the great mass of
the people,—secondly, by public opinion, as arising out of the impartial
reason and enlightened intellect of the community. What is
it that determines the opinion of any number of persons in things they
actually feel in their practical and home results? Their common
interest. What is it that determines their opinion in things of general
inquiry, beyond their immediate experience or interest? Abstract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>reason. In matters of feeling and common sense, of which each
individual is the best judge, the majority are in the right; in things
requiring a greater strength of mind to comprehend them, the greatest
power of understanding will prevail, if it has but fair play. These
two, taken together, as the test of the practical measures or general
principles of Government, must be right, cannot be wrong. It is an
absurdity to suppose that there can be any better criterion of national
grievances, or the proper remedies for them, than the aggregate
amount of the actual, dear-bought experience, the honest feelings,
and heartfelt wishes of a whole people, informed and directed by
the greatest power of understanding in the community, unbiassed by
any sinister motive. Any other standard of public good or ill must,
in proportion as it deviates from this, be vitiated in principle, and
fatal in its effects. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vox populi vox Dei</span></i>, is the rule of all good
Government: for in that voice, truly collected and freely expressed
(not when it is made the servile echo of a corrupt Court, or a
designing Minister), we have all the sincerity and all the wisdom
of the community. If we could suppose society to be transformed
into one great animal (like Hobbes’s Leviathan), each member of
which had an intimate connexion with the head or Government, so
that every individual in it could be made known and have its due
weight, the State would have the same consciousness of its own wants
and feelings, and the same interest in providing for them, as an
individual has with respect to his own welfare. Can any one doubt
that such a state of society in which the greatest knowledge of its
interests was thus combined with the greatest sympathy with its
wants, would realize the idea of a perfect Commonwealth? But such
a Government would be the precise idea of a truly popular or <em>representative</em>
Government. The opposite extreme is the purely hereditary
and despotic form of Government, where the people are an inert,
torpid mass, without the power, scarcely with the will, to make its
wants or wishes known: and where the feelings of those who are at
the head of the State, centre in their own exclusive interests, pride,
passions, prejudices; and all their thoughts are employed in defeating
the happiness and undermining the liberties of a country.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not denied that the people are best acquainted with their own
wants, and most attached to their own interests. But then a question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>is started, as if the persons asking it were at a great loss for the
answer,—Where are we to find the intellect of the people? Why,
all the intellect that ever was is theirs. The public opinion expresses
not only the collective sense of the whole people, but of all ages and
nations, of all those minds that have devoted themselves to the love
of truth and the good of mankind,—who have bequeathed their instructions,
their hopes, and their example to posterity,—who have
thought, spoke, written, acted, and suffered in the name and on
the behalf of our common nature. All the greatest poets, sages,
heroes, are ours originally, and by right. But surely Lord Bacon
was a great man? Yes; but not because he was a lord. There is
nothing of hereditary growth but pride and prejudice. That ‘fine
word Legitimate’ never produced any thing but bastard philosophy
and patriotism! Even Burke was one of the people, and would have
remained with the people to the last, if there had been no court-side
for him to go over to. The King gave him his pension, not his
understanding or his eloquence. It would have been better for him
and for mankind if he had kept to his principles, and gone without his
pension. It is thus that the tide of power constantly setting in against
the people, swallows up natural genius and acquired knowledge in the
vortex of corruption, and then they reproach us with our want of
leaders of weight and influence, to stem the torrent. All that has
ever been done for society, has, however, been done for it by this
intellect, before it was cheapened to be a cat’s-paw of divine right.
All discoveries and all improvements in arts, in science, in legislation,
in civilization, in every thing dear and valuable to the heart of man,
have been made by this intellect—all the triumphs of human genius
over the rudest barbarism, the darkest ignorance, the grossest and
most inhuman superstition, the most unmitigated and remorseless
tyranny, have been gained for themselves by the people. Great
Kings, great law-givers, great founders, and great reformers of religion,
have almost all arisen from among the people. What have hereditary
Monarchs, or regular Governments, or established priesthoods, ever
done for the people? Did the Pope and Cardinals first set on foot
the Reformation? Did the Jesuits attempt to abolish the Inquisition?
For what one measure of civil or religious liberty did our own Bench
of Bishops ever put themselves forward? What judge ever proposed
a reform in the laws! Have not the House of Commons, with
all their ‘tried wisdom,’ voted for every measure of Ministers for the
last twenty-five years, except the Income-tax? It is the press that
has done every thing for the people, and even for Governments.—‘If
they had not ploughed with our heifer, they would not have
found out our riddle.’ And it has done this by slow degrees, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>repeated, incessant, and incredible struggles with the oldest, most
inveterate, powerful, and active enemies of the freedom of the press
and of the people, who wish, in spite of the nature of things and
of society, to retain the idle and mischievous privileges they possess
as the relics of barbarous and feudal times, who have an exclusive
interest as a separate cast in the continuance of all existing abuses, and
who plead a permanent <em>vested right</em> in the prevention of the progress
of reason, liberty, and civilization. Yet they tax us with our want
of intellect; and <em>we</em> ask them in return for their court-list of great
names in arts or philosophy, for the coats of arms of their heroic
vanquishers of error and intolerance, for their devout benefactors and
royal martyrs of humanity. What are the claims of the people—the
obvious, undoubted rights of common justice and humanity, forcibly
withheld from them by pride, bigotry, and selfishness,—demanded
for them, age after age, year after year, by the wisdom and virtue of
the enlightened and disinterested part of mankind, and only grudgingly
yielded up, with indecent, disgusting excuses, and sickening delays,
when the burning shame of their refusal can be no longer concealed
by fear or favour from the whole world. What did it not cost to
abolish the Slave Trade? How long will the Catholic Claims be
withheld by our State-jugglers? How long, and for what purpose?
We may appeal, in behalf of the people, from the interested verdict
of the worst and weakest men now living, to the disinterested reason
of the best and wisest men among the living and the dead. We
appeal from the corruption of Courts, the hypocrisy of zealots, and
the dotage of hereditary imbecility, to the innate love of liberty in the
human breast, and to the growing intellect of the world. We appeal
to the pen, and they answer us with the point of the bayonet; and, at
one time, when that had failed, they were for recommending the
dagger.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c011'><sup>[49]</sup></a> They quote Burke, but rely on the Attorney-General.
They hold Universal Suffrage to be the most dreadful of all things,
and a Standing Army the best representatives of the people abroad
and at home. They think Church-and-King mobs good things, for
the same reason that they are alarmed at a meeting to petition for a
Reform of Parliament. They consider the cry of ‘No Popery’
a sound, excellent, and constitutional cry,—but the cry of a starving
population for food, strange and unnatural. They exalt the war-whoop
of the Stock-Exchange into the voice of undissembled
patriotism, while they set down the cry for peace as the work of the
Jacobins, the ventriloquism of the secret enemies of their country.
The writers on the popular side of the question are factious, designing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>demagogues, who delude the people to make tools of them: but the
government-writers, who echo every calumny, and justify every
encroachment on the people, are profound philosophers and very
honest men. Thus when Mr. John Gifford, the Editor of the
‘Anti-Jacobin’ (not Mr. William Gifford, who at present holds the
same office under Government, as the Editor of the ‘Quarterly
Review’), denounced Mr. Coleridge as a person, who had ‘left his
wife destitute and his children fatherless,’ and proceeded to add—‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex
hoc disce</span></i> his friends Lamb and Southey’—we are to suppose that he
was influenced in this gratuitous statement purely by his love for his
King and country. Loyalty, patriotism, and religion, are regarded as
the natural virtues and plain unerring instincts of the common people:
the mixture of ignorance or prejudice is never objected to in these:
it is only their love of liberty or hatred of oppression that are
discovered, by the same liberal-minded junto, to be proofs of a base
and vulgar disposition. The Bourbons are set over the immense
majority of the French people against their will, because a talent for
governing does not go with numbers. This argument was not
thought of when Bonaparte tried to shew his talent for governing the
people of the Continent against their will, though he had quite as
much talent as the Bourbons. Mr. Canning rejoiced that the first
successful resistance to Bonaparte was made in Russia, a country of
barbarians and slaves. The heroic struggles of ‘the universal Spanish
nation’ in the cause of freedom and independence, have ended in the
destruction of the Cortes and the restoration of the Inquisition, but
without making the Duke of Wellington look thoughtful:—not a
single renegado poet has vented his indignation in a single ode, elegy,
or sonnet; nor does Mr. Southey ‘make him a willow cabin at its
gate, write loyal cantos of contemned love, and sing them loud even
in the dead of the night!’ He indeed assures us in the ‘Quarterly
Review,’ that the Inquisition was restored by the voice of the Spanish
people. He also asks, in the same place, ‘whether the voice of God
was heard in the voice of the people at Jerusalem, when they cried,
“Crucify him, crucify him”?’ We do not know; but we suppose,
he would hardly go to the Chief Priests and Pharisees to find it.
This great historian, politician, and logician, breaks out into a
rhapsody against the old maxim, ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox populi vox Dei</span></i>, in the midst of
an article of 55 pages, written expressly to prove that the last war
was ‘the most popular, <em>because</em> the most just and necessary war that
ever was carried on.’ He shrewdly asks, ‘Has the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox populi</span></i> been
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox Dei</span></i> in France for the last twenty-five years?’ But, at least,
according to his own shewing, it has been so in this country for all
that period. We, however, do not think so. The voice of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>country has been for war, because the voice of the King was for it,
which was echoed by Parliament, both Lords and Commons, by
Clergy and Gentry, and by the populace, till, as Mr. Southey himself
states in the same connected chain of reasoning, the cry for war
became <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">so</span></i> popular, that all those who did not join in it (of which
number the Poet-laureate himself was one) were ‘persecuted, insulted,
and injured in their persons, fame, and fortune.’ This is the true
way of accounting for the fact, but it unfortunately knocks the Poet’s
inference on the head. Mr. Locke has observed, that there are not
so many wrong opinions in the world as we are apt to believe,
because most people take their opinions on trust from others. Neither
are the opinions of the people their own, when they have been bribed
or bullied into them by a mob of Lords and Gentlemen, following
in full cry at the heels of the Court. The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox populi</span></i> is the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox Dei</span></i>
only when it springs from the individual, unbiassed feelings, and
unfettered, independent opinion of the people. Mr. Southey does
not understand the terms of this good old adage, now that he is so
furious against it: we fear, he understood them no better when he
was as loudly in favour of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the objections, indeed, to the voice of the people being the
best rule for Government to attend to, arise from the stops and
impediments to the expression of that voice, from the attempts to
stifle or to give it a false bias, and to cut off its free and open
communication with the head and heart of the people—by the
Government itself. The sincere expression of the feelings of the
people must be true; the full and free development of the public
opinion must lead to truth, to the gradual discovery and diffusion of
knowledge in this, as in all other departments of human inquiry. It
is the interest of Governments in general to keep the people in a state
of vassalage as long as they can—to prevent the expression of their
sentiments, and the exercise and improvement of their understandings,
by all the means in their power. They have a patent, and a monopoly,
which they do not like to have looked into or to share with others.
The argument for keeping the people in a state of lasting wardship,
or for treating them as lunatics, incapable of self-government, wears a
very suspicious aspect, as it comes from those who are trustees to the
estate, or keepers of insane asylums. The long minority of the
people would, at this rate, never expire, while those who had an
interest had also the power to prevent them from arriving at years of
discretion: their government-keepers have nothing to do but to drive
the people mad by ill-treatment, and to keep them so by worse, in
order to retain the pretence for applying the gag, the strait waistcoat,
and the whip as long as they please. It is like the dispute between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Mr. Epps, the angry shopkeeper in the Strand, and his journeyman,
whom he would restrict from setting up for himself. Shall we never
serve out our apprenticeship to liberty? Must our indentures to
slavery bind us for life? It is well, it is perfectly well. You teach
us nothing, and you will not let us learn. You deny us education, like
Orlando’s eldest brother, and then ‘stying us’ in the den of legitimacy,
you refuse to let us take the management of our own affairs into our
own hands, or to seek our fortunes in the world ourselves. You found
a right to treat us with indignity on the plea of your own neglect and
injustice. You abuse a trust in order to make it perpetual. You
profit of our ignorance and of your own wrong. You degrade,
and then enslave us; and by enslaving, you degrade us more, to
make us more and more incapable of ever escaping from your
selfish, sordid yoke. There is no end of this. It is the fear of
the progress of knowledge and a <em>Reading Public</em>, that has produced
all the fuss and bustle and cant about Bell and Lancaster’s
plans, Bible and Missionary, and Auxiliary and Cheap Tract
Societies, and that when it was impossible to prevent our reading
something, made the Church and State so anxious to provide us
with that sort of food for our stomachs, which they thought best.
The Bible is an excellent book; and when it becomes the Statesman’s
Manual, in its precepts of charity—not of beggarly alms-giving,
but of peace on earth and good will to man, the people
may read nothing else. It reveals the glories of the world to
come, and records the preternatural dispensations of Providence
to mankind two thousand years ago. But it does not describe the
present state of Europe, or give an account of the measures of
the last or of the next reign, which yet it is important the people of
England should look to. We cannot learn from Moses and the
Prophets what Mr. Vansittart and the Jews are about in ‘Change-alley.
Those who prescribe us the study of the miracles and
prophecies, themselves laugh to scorn the promised deliverance of
Joanna Southcott and the Millennium. Yet they would have us
learn patience and resignation from the miraculous interpositions of
Providence recorded in the Scriptures. ‘<em>When the sky falls</em>’—the
proverb is somewhat musty. The worst compliment ever paid to
the Bible was the recommendation of it as a political palliative by the
Lay Preachers of the day.</p>

<p class='c010'>To put this question in a different light, we might ask, What is
the public? and examine what would be the result of depriving
the people of the use of their understandings in other matters as
well as government—to subject them to the trammels of prescriptive
prejudice and hereditary pretension. Take the stage as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>example. Suppose Mr. Kean should have a son, a little crook-kneed,
raven-voiced, disagreeable, mischievous, stupid urchin,
with the faults of his father’s acting exaggerated tenfold, and none
of his fine qualities,—what if Mr. Kean should take it into his
head to get out letters-patents to empower him and his heirs for
ever, with this hopeful commencement, to play all the chief parts
in tragedy, by the grace of God and the favour of the Prince
Regent! What a precious race of tragedy kings and heroes we
should have! They would not even play the villain with a good
grace. The theatres would soon be deserted, and the race of the
Keans would ‘hold a barren sceptre’ over empty houses, to be
‘wrenched from them by an unlineal hand!’—But no! For it
would be necessary to uphold theatrical order, the cause of the
legitimate drama, and so to levy a tax on all those who staid away
from the theatre, or to drag them into it by force. Every one
seeing the bayonet at the door, would be compelled to applaud
the hoarse tones and lengthened pauses of the illustrious house of
Kean; the newspaper critics would grow wanton in their praise,
and all those would be held as rancorous enemies of their country,
and of the prosperity of the stage, who did not join in the praises
of the best of actors. What a falling off there would be from the
present system of universal suffrage and open competition among
the candidates, the frequency of rows in the pit, the noise in the
gallery, the whispers in the boxes, and the lashing in the newspapers
the next day!</p>

<p class='c010'>In fact, the argument drawn from the supposed incapacity of
the people against a representative Government, comes with the
worst grace in the world from the patrons and admirers of hereditary
government. Surely, if government were a thing requiring
the utmost stretch of genius, wisdom, and virtue, to carry it on,
the office of King would never even have been dreamt of as hereditary,
any more than that of poet, painter, or philosopher. It is
easy here ‘for the Son to tread in the Sire’s steady steps.’ It
requires nothing but the will to do it. Extraordinary talents are not
once looked for. Nay, a person, who would never have risen by
natural abilities to the situation of churchwarden or parish beadle,
succeeds by unquestionable right to the possession of a throne
and wields the energies of an empire, or decides the fate of the
world, with the smallest possible share of human understanding.
The line of distinction which separates the regal purple from the
slabbering-bib, is sometimes fine indeed; as we see in the case of
the two Ferdinands. Any one above the rank of an ideot is supposed
capable of exercising the highest functions of royal state. Yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>these are the persons who talk of the people as a swinish multitude,
and taunt them with their want of refinement and philosophy.</p>
<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c010'>The great problem of political science is not of so profoundly
metaphysical or highly poetical a cast as Mr. Burke represents it.
It is simply a question on the one part, with how little expense of
liberty and property the Government, ‘that complex constable,’
as it has been quaintly called, can keep the peace; and on the
other part, for how great a sacrifice of both, the splendour of the
throne and the safety of the state can be made a pretext. Kings
and their Ministers generally strive to get their hands in our
pockets, and their feet on our necks; the people and their representatives
will be wise enough, if they can only contrive to prevent
them; but this, it must be confessed, they do not always succeed
in. For a people to be free, it is sufficient that they will to be
free. But the love of liberty is less strong than the love of power;
and is guided by a less sure instinct in attaining its object. Milton
only spoke the sentiments of the English people of his day (sentiments
too which they had acted upon), in strong language, when
he said, in answer to a foreign pedant:—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘<em>Liceat, quæso, populo
qui servitutis jugum in cervicibus grave sentit, tam sapienti esse,
tam docto, tamque nobili, ut sciat quid tyranno suo faciendum sit,
etiamsi neque exteros neque grammaticos sciscitatum mittat.</em>’—(<em>Defensio
pro populo Anglicano.</em>)</span> Happily the whole of the passage
is not applicable to their descendants in the present day; but
at all times a people may be allowed to know when they are
oppressed, enslaved, and miserable, to feel their wrongs and to
demand a remedy—from the superior knowledge and humanity of
Ministers, who, if they cannot cure the State-malady, ought in
decency, like other doctors, to resign their authority over the
patient. The people are not subject to fanciful wants, speculative
longings, or hypochondriacal complaints. Their disorders
are real, their complaints substantial and well-founded. Their
grumblings are in general seditions of the belly. They do not cry
out till they are hurt. They do not stand upon nice questions, or
trouble themselves with Mr. Burke’s Sublime and Beautiful; but
when they find the money conjured clean out of their pockets,
and the Constitution suspended over their heads, they think it time
to look about them. For example, poor Evans, that amateur of
music and politics (strange combination of tastes), thought it hard,
no doubt to be sent to prison and deprived of his flute by a
State-warrant, because there was no ground for doing it by law;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and Mr. Hiley Addington, being himself a flute-player, thought
so too: though, in spite of this romantic sympathy, the Minister
prevailed over the musician, and Mr. Evans has, we believe,
never got back his flute. For an act of injustice, by the new
system, if complained of ‘forsooth,’ becomes justifiable by the
very resistance to it: if not complained of, nobody knows any
thing about it, and so it goes equally unredressed in either way.
Or to take another obvious instance and sign of the times: a
tenant or small farmer who has been distrained upon and sent to
gaol or to the workhouse, probably thinks, and with some appearance
of reason, that he was better off before this change of
circumstances; and Mr. Cobbett, in his twopenny Registers,
proves to him so clearly, that this change for the worse is owing to
the war and taxes, which have driven him out of his house and
home, that Mr. Cobbett himself has been forced to quit the
country to argue the question, whether two and two make four,
with Mr. Vansittart, upon safer ground to himself, and more equal
ground to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Such questions as
these are, one would think, within the verge of common sense and
reason. For any thing we could ever find, the people have as
much common sense and sound judgment as any other class of
the community. Their folly is second-hand, derived from their
being the dupe of the passions, interests, and prejudices of their
superiors. When they judge for themselves, they in general
judge right. At any rate, the way to improve their judgment in
their own concerns (and if they do not judge for themselves, they
will infallibly be cheated both of liberty and property, by those
who kindly insist on relieving them of that trouble) is not to deny
them the use and exercise of their judgment altogether. Nothing
can be pleasanter than one of the impositions of late attempted to
be put upon the people, by persuading them that economy is no
part of a wise Government. The people must be pretty competent
judges of the cheapness of a Government. But it is pretended
by our high-flying sinecurists and pensioners, that this is a
low and vulgar view of the subject, taken up by interested knaves,
like Paine and Cobbett, to delude, and, in the end, make their
market of the people. With all the writers and orators who
compose the band of gentlemen pensioners and their patrons,
politics is entirely a thing of sentiment and imagination. To
speak of the expenses of Government, as if it were a little paltry
huckstering calculation of profit and loss, quite shocks their lofty,
liberal, and disinterested notions. They have no patience with
the people if they are not ready to sacrifice their all for the public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>good! This is something like a little recruiting cavalry-lieutenant
we once met with, who, sorely annoyed at being so
often dunned for the arrears of board and lodging by the people
where he took up his quarters, exclaimed with the true broad
Irish accent and emphasis—‘<em>Vulgar ideas! These wretches
always expect one to pay for what one has of them!</em>’ Our modest
lieutenant thought, that while he was employed on his Majesty’s
service, he had a right to pick the pockets of his subjects, and
that if they complained of being robbed of what was their own,
they were blackguards and <em>no gentlemen</em>! Mr. Canning hit
upon nothing so good as this, in his luminous defence of his
Lisbon Job!</p>

<p class='c010'>But allow the people to be as gross and ignorant as you please,
as base and stupid as you can make them or keep them, ‘duller
than the fat weed that roots itself at ease on Lethe’s wharf,’—is
nothing ever to rouse them? Grant that they are slow of apprehension—that
they do not see till they feel. Is that a reason that
they are not to feel then, neither? Would you blindfold them
with the double bandages of bigotry, or quench their understandings
with ‘the dim suffusion,’ ‘the drop serene,’ of Legitimacy,
that ‘they may roll in vain and find no dawn’ of liberty,
no ray of hope? Because they do not see tyranny till it is mountain
high, ‘making Ossa like a wart,’ are they not to feel its
weight when it is heaped upon them, or to throw it off with giant
strength and a convulsive effort? If they do not see the evil till
it has grown enormous, palpable, and undeniable, is that a reason
why others should then deny that it exists, or why it should not
be removed? They do not snuff arbitrary power a century off:
they are not shocked at it on the other side of the globe, or of
the Channel: are they not therefore to see it, could it in time be
supposed to stalk over their heads, to trample and grind them to
the earth? If in their uncertainty how to deal with it, they
sometimes strike random blows, if their despair makes them
dangerous, why do not they, who, from their elevated situation,
see so much farther and deeper into the principles and consequences
of things—in their boasted wisdom prevent the causes
of complaint in the people before they accumulate to a terrific
height, and burst upon the heads of their oppressors? The
higher classes, who would disqualify the people from taking the
cure of their disorders into their own hands, might do this very
effectually, by preventing the first symptoms of their disorders.
They would do well, instead of abusing the blunders and brutishness
of the multitude, to shew their superior penetration and zeal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>in detecting the first approaches of mischief, in withstanding
every encroachment on the comforts and rights of the people, in
guarding every bulwark against the influence and machinations of
arbitrary power, as a precious, inviolable, sacred trust. Instead
of this, they are the first to be lulled into security, a security ‘as
gross as ignorance made drunk’—the last to believe the consequences,
because they are the last to feel them. Instead of this,
the patience of the lower classes, in submitting to privations and
insults, is only surpassed by the callousness of their betters in
witnessing them. The one never set about the redress of grievances
or the reform of abuses, till they are no longer to be borne;
the others will not hear of it even then. It is for this reason,
among others, that the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox populi</span></i> is the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox Dei</span></i>, that it is the
agonizing cry of human nature raised, and only raised, against intolerable
oppression and the utmost extremity of human suffering.
The people do not rise up till they are trod down. They do not
turn upon their tormentors till they are goaded to madness.
They do not complain till the thumb-screws have been applied,
and have been strained to the last turn. Nothing can ever wean
the affections or confidence of a people from a Government (to
which habit, prejudice, natural pride, perhaps old benefits and
joint struggles for liberty have attached them) but an excessive
degree of irritation and disgust, occasioned either by a sudden and
violent stretch of power, contrary to the spirit and forms of the
established Government, or by a blind and wilful adherence to
old abuses and established forms, when the changes in the state
of manners and opinion have rendered them as odious as they are
ridiculous. The Revolutions of Switzerland, the Low Countries,
and of America, are examples of the former—the French Revolution
of the latter: our own Revolution of 1688 was a mixture
of the two. As a general rule, it might be laid down, that for
every instance of national resistance to tyranny, there ought to
have been hundreds, and that all those which have been attempted
ought to have succeeded. In the case of Wat Tyler,
for instance, which has been so naturally dramatised by the poet-laureate,
the rebellion was crushed, and the ringleaders hanged
by the treachery of the Government; but the grievances of which
they had complained were removed a few years after, and the
rights they had claimed granted to the people, from the necessary
progress of civilization and knowledge. Did not Mr. Southey
know, when he applied for an injunction against Wat Tyler, that
the feudal system had been abolished long ago?—Again, as
nothing rouses the people to resistance but extreme and aggravated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>injustice, so nothing can make them persevere in it, or push their
efforts to a successful and triumphant issue, but the most open and
unequivocal determination to brave their cries and insult their
misery. They have no principle of union in themselves, and
nothing brings or holds them together, but the strong pressure of
want, the stern hand of necessity—‘a necessity that is not
chosen, but chuses,—a necessity paramount to deliberation, that
admits of no discussion and demands no evidence, that can alone,
(according to Mr. Burke’s theory) justify a resort to anarchy,’
and that alone ever did or can produce it. In fine, there are but
two things in the world, might and right. Whenever one of these
is overcome, it is by the other. The triumphs of the people, or
the stand which they at any time make against arbitrary sway, are
the triumphs of reason and justice over the insolence of individual
power and authority, which, unless as it is restrained, curbed, and
corrected by popular feeling or public opinion, can be guided only
by its own drunken, besotted, mad pride, selfishness and caprice, and
must be productive of all the mischief, which it can wantonly or
deliberately commit with impunity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The people are not apt, like a fine lady, to affect the vapours
of discontent; nor to volunteer a rebellion for the theatrical eclat
of the thing. But the least plausible excuse, one kind word, one
squeeze of the hand, one hollow profession of good will, subdues
the soft heart of rebellion, (which is ‘too foolish fond and pitiful’
to be a match for the callous hypocrisy opposed to it) dissolves
and melts the whole fabric of popular innovation like butter in
the sun. Wat Tyler is a case in point again. The instant the
effeminate king and his unprincipled courtiers gave them fair
words, they dispersed, relying in their infatuation on the word of
the King as binding, on the oath of his officers as sincere; and no
sooner were they dispersed than they cut off their leaders’ heads, and
poor John Ball’s along with them, in spite of all his texts of Scripture.
The story is to be seen in all the shop-windows, <em>written in very choice
blank verse</em>!—That the people are rash in trusting to the promises of
their friends, is true; they are more rash in believing their enemies.
If they are led to expect too much in theory, they are satisfied with
too little in reality. Their anger is sometimes fatal while it lasts, but
it is not roused very soon, nor does it last very long. Of all dynasties,
anarchy is the shortest lived. They are violent in their revenge, no
doubt; but it is because justice has been long denied them, and they
have to pay off a very long score at a very short notice. What
Cæsar says of himself, might be applied well enough to the people,
that they ‘did never wrong but with just cause.’ The errors of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>people are the crimes of Governments. They apply sharp remedies
to lingering diseases, and when they get sudden power in their hands,
frighten their enemies, and wound themselves with it. They rely on
brute force and the fury of despair, in proportion to the treachery
which surrounds them, and to the degradation, the want of general
information and mutual co-operation, in which they have been kept,
on purpose to prevent them from ever acting in concert, with wisdom,
energy, confidence, and calmness, for the public good. The American
Revolution produced no horrors, because its enemies could not
succeed in sowing the seeds of terror, hatred, mutual treachery, and
universal dismay in the hearts of the people. The French Revolution,
under the auspices of Mr. Burke, and other friends of social
order, was tolerably prolific of these horrors. But that should not
be charged as the fault of the Revolution or of the people. Timely
Reforms are the best preventives of violent Revolutions. If Governments
are determined that the people shall have no redress, no
remedies for their acknowledged grievances, but violent and desperate
ones, they may thank themselves for the obvious consequences.
Despotism must always have the most to fear from the re-action of
popular fury, where it has been guilty of the greatest abuses of
power, and where it has shewn the greatest tenaciousness of those
abuses, putting an end to all prospect of amicable arrangement, and
provoking the utmost vengeance of its oppressed and insulted victims.
This tenaciousness of power is the chief obstacle to improvement, and
the cause of the revulsions which follow the attempts at it. In
America, a free Government was easy of accomplishment, because it
was not necessary, in building up, to pull down: there were no
nuisances to abate. The thing is plain. Reform in old Governments
is just like the new improvements in the front of Carlton House, that
would go on fast enough but for the vile, old, dark, dirty, crooked
streets, which cannot be removed without giving the inhabitants notice
to quit. Mr. Burke, in regretting these old institutions as the result
of the wisdom of ages, and not the remains of Gothic ignorance and
barbarism, played the part of <em>Crockery</em>, in the farce of <cite>Exit by Mistake</cite>,
who sheds tears of affection over the loss of the old windows and
buttresses of the houses that no longer jut out to meet one another,
and stop up the way.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is one other consideration which may induce hereditary
Sovereigns to allow some weight to the arguments in favour of
popular feeling and public opinion. They are the only security which
they themselves possess individually for the continuance of their
splendour and power. Absolute monarchs have nothing to fear from
the people, but they have every thing to fear from their slaves and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>one another. Where power is lifted beyond the reach of the law or
of public opinion, there is no principle to oppose it, and he who can
obtain possession of the throne (by whatever means) is always the
rightful possessor of it, till he is supplanted by a more fortunate or
artful successor, and so on in a perpetual round of treasons, conspiracies,
murders, usurpations, regicides, and rebellions, with which
the people have nothing to do, but as passive, unconcerned spectators.—Where
the son succeeds to the father’s throne by assassination,
without being amenable to public justice, he is liable to be cut off
himself by the same means, and with the same impunity. The only
thing that can give stability or confidence to power, is that very will
of the people, and public censure exercised upon public acts, of which
legitimate Sovereigns are so disproportionately apprehensive. For one
regicide committed by the people, there have been thousands committed
by Kings themselves. A Constitutional King of England
reigns in greater security than the Persian Sophi, or the Great
Mogul; and the Emperor of Turkey, or the Autocrat of all the
Russias, has much more to fear from a cup of coffee or the bowstring,
than the Prince Regent from the speeches and writings of all
the Revolutionists in Europe. By removing the barrier of public
opinion, which interferes with their own lawless acts, despotic Kings
lay themselves open to the hand of the assassin,—and while they
reign in contempt of the will, the voice, the heart and mind of a
whole people, hold their crowns, and every moment of their lives at
the mercy of the meanest of their slaves.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>ON THE REGAL CHARACTER</h3>

      <div class='line'><em>May 16, 1818.</em></div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>This is a subject exceedingly curious, and worth explaining. In
writing a criticism, we hope we shall not be accused of intending
a libel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Kings are remarkable for long memories, in the merest trifles.
They never forget a face or person they have once seen, nor an
anecdote they have been told of any one they know. Whatever
differences of character or understanding they manifest in other
respects, they all possess what Dr. Spurzheim would call the <em>organ
of individuality</em>, or the power of recollecting particular local circumstances,
nearly in the same degree; though we shall attempt to
account for it without recurring to his system. This kind of personal
memory is the natural effect of that self-importance which makes them
attach a corresponding importance to all that comes in contact with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>themselves. Nothing can be a matter of indifference to a King, that
happens to a King. That intense consciousness of their personal
identity, which never quits them, extends to whatever falls under
their immediate cognisance. It is the glare of Majesty reflected
from their own persons on the persons of those about them that fixes
their attention; and it is the same false glare that makes them blind
and insensible to all that lies beyond that narrow sphere. ‘My
Lord,’ said an English King to one of his courtiers, ‘I have seen
you in that coat before with different buttons’—to the astonishment
of the Noble Peer. There was nothing wonderful in it. It was the
habitual jealousy of the Sovereign of the respect due to him, that
made him regard with lynx-eyed watchfulness even the accidental
change of dress in one of his favourites. The least diminution of
glossy splendour in a birth-day suit, considered as a mark of slackened
duty, or waning loyalty, would expose it, tarnished and thread-bare,
to the keen glance of dormant pride, waked to suspicion. A God
does not penetrate into the hearts of his worshippers with surer
insight, than a King, fond of the attributes of awe and sovereignty,
detects the different degrees of hollow adulation in those around him.
Every thing relating to external appearance and deportment is scanned
with the utmost nicety, as compromising the dignity of the royal
presence. Involuntary gestures become overt acts; a look is construed
into high treason; an inconsiderate word is magnified into a
crime against the State. To suggest advice, or offer information
unasked, is to arraign the fallibility of the throne: to hint a difference
of opinion to a King, would create as great a shock, as if you were to
present a pistol to the breast of any other man. ‘Never touch a
King,’ was the answer of an infirm Monarch to one who had saved
him from a dangerous fall. When a glass of wine was presented to
the Emperor Alexander by a servant in livery, he started, as if he
had trod upon a serpent. Such is their respect for themselves!
Such is their contempt for human nature!—‘There’s a divinity doth
hedge a King,’ that keeps their bodies and their minds sacred within
the magic circle of a name; and it is their fear lest this circle should
be violated or approached without sufficient awe, that makes them
observe and remember the countenances and demeanour of others with
such infinite circumspection and exactness.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Kings have the sagacity of pride, courtiers have the cunning of
fear. They watch their own behaviour and that of others with
breathless apprehension, and move amidst the artificial forms of court-etiquette,
as if the least error must be fatal to them. Their sense of
personal propriety is heightened by servility: every faculty is wound
up to flatter the vanity and prejudices of their superiors. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Coates painted a portrait in crayons of the Queen, on her first arrival
in this country, the King, followed by a train of attendants, went to
look at it. The trembling artist stood by. ‘Well, what do you
think?’ said the King to those in waiting. Not a word in reply.
‘Do you think it like?’ Still all was hushed as death. ‘Why,
yes, I think it is like, very like.’ A buzz of admiration instantly
filled the room; and the old Duchess of Northumberland, going up
to the artist, and tapping him familiarly on the shoulder, said,
‘Remember, Mr. Coates, I am to have the first copy.’ On another
occasion, when the Queen had sat for her portrait, one of the Maids
of Honour coming into the room, curtsied to the reflection in the
glass, affecting to mistake it for the Queen. The picture was, you
may be sure, a flattering likeness. In the ‘Memoirs of Count
Grammont,’ it is related of Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> that having a dispute at
chess with one of his courtiers, no one present would give an opinion.
‘Oh!’ said he, ‘here comes Count Hamilton, he shall decide which
of us is in the right.’ ‘Your Majesty is in the wrong,’ replied the
Count, without looking at the board. On which, the King remonstrating
with him on the impossibility of his judging till he
saw the state of the game, he answered, ‘Does your Majesty suppose
that if you were in the right, all these noblemen would stand by and
say nothing?’ A King was once curious to know, which was the
tallest, himself or a certain courtier. ‘Let us measure,’ said the
King. The King stood up to be measured first; but when the
person who was fixed upon to take their height came to measure the
Nobleman, he found it quite impossible, as he first rose on tip-toe,
then crouched down, now shrugged up his shoulders to the right,
then twisted his body to the left. Afterwards his friend asking him
the reason of these unaccountable gesticulations, he replied, ‘I could
not tell whether the King wished me to be taller or shorter than
himself; and all the time I was making those odd movements, I was
watching his countenance to see what I ought to do.’ If such is the
exquisite pliability of the inmates of a court in trifles like these, what
must be their independence of spirit and disinterested integrity in
questions of peace and war, that involve the rights of Sovereigns or
the liberties of the people! It has been suggested (and not without
reason), that the difficulty of trusting to the professions of those who
surround them, is one circumstance that renders Kings such expert
physiognomists, the language of the countenance being the only one
they have left to decypher the thoughts of others; and the very
disguises which are practised to prevent the emotions of the mind
from appearing in the face, only rendering them more acute and
discriminating observers. It is the same insincerity and fear of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>giving offence by candour and plain-speaking in their immediate
dependents, that makes Kings gossips and inquisitive. They have
no way of ascertaining the opinions of others, but by getting them up
into a corner, and extorting the commonest information from them,
piecemeal, by endless teasing tiresome questions, and cross-examination.
The walls of a palace, like those of a nunnery, are the favoured
abode of scandal and tittle-tattle. The inhabitants of both are equally
shut out from the common privileges and common incidents of
humanity, and whatever relates to the every-day world about us,
has to them the air of a romance. The desire which the most
meritorious Princes have shewn to acquire information on matters of
fact rather than of opinion, is partly because their prejudices will not
suffer them to exercise their understandings freely on the most
important speculative questions, partly from their jealousy of being
dictated to on any point that admits of a question;—as, on the other
hand, the desire which the Sovereigns of northern and uncultivated
kingdoms have shewn to become acquainted with the arts and
elegances of life in southern nations, is evidently owing to their
natural jealousy of the advantages of civilization over barbarism.
From the principle last stated, Peter the Great visited this country,
and worked in our dock-yards as a common shipwright. To the
same source may be traced the curiosity of the Duchess of Oldenburgh
to see a beef-steak cooked, to take a peep into Mr. Meux’s great
brewing-vat, and to hear Mr. Whitbread speak!</p>

<p class='c010'>The common regal character is then the reverse of what it ought
to be. It is the purely <em>personal</em>, occupied with its own petty feelings,
prejudices, and pursuits; whereas it ought to be the purely philosophical,
exempt from all personal considerations, and contemplating
itself only in its general and paramount relation to the State. This
is the reason why there have been so few great Kings. They want
the power of abstraction: and their situations are necessarily at
variance with their duties, in this respect; for every thing forces
them to concentrate their attention upon themselves, and to consider
their rank and privileges in connexion with their private advantage,
rather than with public good. This is but natural. It is easier to
employ the power they possess in pampering their own appetites and
passions, than to wield it for the benefit of a great empire. They
see well enough how the community is made for them, not so well
how they are made for the community. Not knowing how to act as
stewards for their trust, they set up for heirs to the estate, and waste
it at their pleasure:—without aspiring to reign as Kings, they are
contented to live as <em>spunges</em> upon royalty. A great King ought to be
the greatest philosopher and the truest patriot in his dominions:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>hereditary Kings can be but common mortals. It is not that they
are not equal to other men, but to be equal to their rank as Kings,
they ought to be more than men. Their power is equal to that of
the whole community: their wisdom and virtue ought to keep pace
with their power. But in ordinary cases, the height to which they
are raised, instead of enlarging their views or ennobling their
sentiments, makes them giddy with vanity, and ready to look down
on the world which is subjected to their power, as the plaything of
their will. They regard men crawling on the face of the earth, as
we do insects that cross our path, and survey the common drama of
human life, as a fantoccini exhibition got up for their amusement.
There is no sympathy between Kings and their subjects—except in a
constitutional monarchy like ours, through the medium of Lords and
Commons! Take away that check upon their ambition and rapacity,
and their pretensions become as monstrous as they are ridiculous.
Without the common feelings of humanity in their own breasts, they
have no regard for them in their aggregate amount and accumulating
force. Reigning in contempt of the people, they would crush and
trample upon all power but their own. They consider the claims of
justice and compassion as so many impertinent interferences with the
royal prerogative. They despise the millions of slaves whom they
see linked to the foot of the throne; and they soon hate what they
despise. They will sacrifice a kingdom for a caprice, and mankind
for a bauble. Weighed in the scales of their pride, the meanest
things become of the greatest importance: weighed in the balance of
reason, the universe is nothing to them. It is this overweening,
aggravated, intolerable sense of swelling pride and ungovernable self-will,
that so often drives them mad; as it is their blind fatuity and
insensibility to all beyond themselves, that, transmitted through
successive generations and confirmed by regal intermarriages, in time
makes them idiots. When we see a poor creature like Ferdinand <span class='fss'>VII.</span>,
who can hardly gabble out his words like a human being, more
imbecile than a woman, more hypocritical than a priest, decked and
dandled in the long robes and swaddling-clothes of legitimacy, lullabied
to rest with the dreams of superstition, drunk with the patriot
blood of his country, and launching the thunders of his coward-arm
against the rising liberties of a new world, while he claims the style
and title of Image of the Divinity, we may laugh or weep, but there
is nothing to wonder at. Tyrants lose all respect for humanity in
proportion as they are sunk beneath it;—taught to believe themselves
of a different species, they really become so; lose their
participation with their kind; and, in mimicking the God, dwindle
into the brute! Blind with prejudices as a mole, stung with truth as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>with scorpions, sore all over with wounded pride like a boil, their
minds a heap of morbid proud flesh and bloated humours, a disease
and gangrene in the State, instead of its life-blood and vital principle;—foreign
despots claim mankind as their property, ‘independently
of their conduct or merits,’ and there is one Englishman
found base enough to echo the foul calumny against his country and
his kind.</p>

<p class='c010'>We might, in the same manner, account for the disparity between
the public and private character of Kings. It is the misfortune
of most Kings (not their fault) to be born to thrones, a situation
which ordinary talents or virtue cannot fill with impunity. We often
find a very respectable man make but a very sorry figure as a
Sovereign. Nay, a Prince may be possessed of extraordinary virtues
and accomplishments, and not be the more thought of for them. He
may, for instance, be a man of good nature and good manners,
graceful in his person, the idol of the other sex, the model of his
own; every word or look may be marked with the utmost sense of
propriety and delicate attention to the feelings of others; he may be
a good classic, well versed in history,—may speak Italian, French,
Spanish, and German fluently; he may be an excellent mimic; he
may say good things, and do friendly ones; he may be able to join
in a catch, or utter a repartee, or dictate a billet-doux; he may be
master of Hoyle, and deep in the rules of the Jockey club; he may
have an equal taste in ragouts and poetry, in dancing and in dress;
he may adjust a toupee with the dexterity of a friseur, or tie a
cravat with the hand and eye of a man-milliner: he may have all
these graces and accomplishments, and as many more, and yet he may
be nothing; as without any one of them he may be a great Prince.
They are not the graces and accomplishments of a Sovereign, but of
a lord of the bed-chamber. They do not shew a great mind, bent
on great objects, and swayed by lofty views. They are rather
foibles and blemishes in the character of a ruler, for they imply that
his attention has been turned as much upon adorning his own person
as upon advancing the State. Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> was a King, such as we
have here described; amiable, witty, and accomplished, and yet his
memory is equally despised and detested. Charles was without
strength of mind, or public principle. He could not arrive at the
comprehension of that mixed mass of thought and feeling, a <em>kingdom</em>—he
thought merely of the <em>throne</em>. He was as unlike Cromwell in the
manner in which he came by the sovereignty of the realm as in the
use he made of it. He saw himself, not in the glass of history, but
in the glass on his toilette; not in the eyes of posterity, but in those
of his courtiers and mistresses. Instead of regulating his conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>by public opinion and abstract reason, he did every thing from a
feeling of personal vanity. Charles would have been more annoyed
with the rejection of a licentious overture than with the rebellion of
a province; and poured out the blood of his subjects with the same
gaiety and indifference as he did a glass of wine. He had no idea
of his obligations to the State, and only laid aside the private gentleman,
to become the tyrant of his people. Charles was popular in his
life-time, Cibber tells us, because he used to walk out with his spaniels
and feed his ducks in St. James’s park. History has consigned his
name to infamy for the executions under Jefferies, and for his league
with a legitimate despot (Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span>), to undermine the liberties of
his country.</p>

<p class='c010'>What is it, then, that makes a great Prince? Not the understanding
Purcell or Mozart, but the having an ear open to the voice
of truth and justice! Not a taste in made dishes, or French wines,
or court-dresses, but a fellow-feeling with the calamities of hunger,
of cold, of disease, and nakedness! Not a knowledge of the
elegances of fashionable life, but a heart that feels for the millions
of its fellow-beings in want of the common necessaries of life! Not
a set of brilliant frivolous accomplishments, but a manly strength of
character, proof against the seductions of a throne! He, in short,
is a patriot King, who without any other faculty usually possessed
by Sovereigns, has one which they seldom possess,—the power in
imagination of changing places with his people. Such a King may
indeed aspire to the character of a ruling providence over a nation;
any other is but the head-cypher of a court.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The spirit of poetry in Mr. Moore is not a lying spirit. ‘Set it
down, my tables’—we have still, in the year 1818, three years after
the date of Mr. Southey’s laureateship, one poet, who is an honest
man. We are glad of it: nor does it spoil our theory, for the
exception proves the rule. Mr. Moore unites in himself two names
that were sacred, till they were prostituted by our modern mountebanks,
the Poet and the Patriot. He is neither a coxcomb nor
a catspaw,—a whiffling turncoat, nor a thorough-paced tool, a
mouthing sycophant, ‘a full solempne man,’ like Mr. Wordsworth,—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>whining monk, like Mr. Southey,—a maudlin Methodistical
lay-preacher, like Mr. Coleridge,—a merry Andrew, like the fellow
that plays on the salt-box at Bartlemy Fair,—or the more pitiful
jack-pudding, that makes a jest of humanity in St. Stephen’s Chapel.
Thank God, he is like none of these—he is not one of the Fudge
Family. He is neither a bubble nor a cheat. He makes it his
business neither to hoodwink his own understanding, nor to blind or
gag others. He is a man of wit and fancy, but he does not sharpen
his wit on the edge of human agony, like the House of Commons’
jester, nor strew the flowers of fancy, like the Jesuit Burke, over
the carcase of corruption, for he is a man not only of wit and fancy,
but of common sense and common humanity. He sees for himself,
and he feels for others. He employs the arts of fiction, not to adorn
the deformed, or disguise the false, but to make truth shine out the
clearer, and beauty look more beautiful. He does not make verse,
‘immortal verse,’ the vehicle of lies, the bawd of Legitimacy, the
pander of antiquated prejudices, and of vamped-up sophistry; but
of truths, of home, heartfelt truths, as old as human nature and its
wrongs. Mr. Moore calls things by their right names: he shews us
kings as kings, priests as priests, knaves as knaves, and fools as fools.
He makes us laugh at the ridiculous, and hate the odious. He also
speaks with authority, and not as certain scribes that we could mention.
He has been at Court, and has seen what passes there.</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Tam knew what’s what full brawly.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But he was a man before he became a courtier, and has continued to
be one afterwards; nor has he forgotten what passes in the human
heart. From what he says of the Prince, it is evident that he speaks
from habits of personal intimacy: he speaks of Lord Castlereagh as
his countryman. In the Epistles of the Fudge Family, we see, as
in a glass without a wrinkle, the mind and person of Royalty in full
dress, up to the very throat, and we have a whole-length figure of
his Lordship, in the sweeping, serpentine line of beauty, down to his
very feet.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a>—We have heard it said of our poet, by a late celebrated
wit and orator, that ‘there was no man who put so much of his
heart into his fancy as Tom Moore; that his soul seemed as if it
were a particle of fire separated from the sun, and were always
fluttering to get back to that source of light and heat.’ We think
this criticism as happy as it is just: but it will be evident to the
readers of the <cite>Fudge Family</cite>, that the soul of ‘a certain little gentleman’
is not attracted with the same lively or kindly symptoms to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>the Bourbons, or to their benefactors and restorers ‘under Providence!’
The title of this delightful little collection of sweets and bitters, of
honey and gall, is, we suppose, an allusion to the short ejaculation
which honest Burchell, in the ‘Vicar of Wakefield,’ uttered at the
end of every sentence, in the conversation of Miss Amelia Carolina
Wilhelmina Skeggs and her friend, on the Court and Fashionables;
and which word, ‘Fudge,’ our malicious Editor thinks equally
applicable to the cant upon the same subjects at the present day,—to
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fade politesse</span></i> of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancient regime</span></i>,—to ‘the damnable
face-making’ of Holy Alliances, and ‘the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">flocci-nauci-pili-nihili-fication</span></i>’
of Legitimacy. He may be wrong in this; but if so, we are most
assuredly in the wrong with him: and we confess, it gives us as much
pleasure to agree with this writer, as it does to differ with some
others that we could mention, but that they are not worth mentioning.—The
Correspondents of the Fudge Family in Paris are much of
the same stamp (with one exception) as the Correspondents of
Dr. S——, in his work of that name, which was lately put a stop
to by that sort of censorship of the press which is exercised by the
reading public; only the Correspondents in the present volume have
a very different Editor from him of ‘<cite>The Day and New Times</cite>,’ or,
as it is at present called, <cite>The New Times</cite> alone, the <cite>Day</cite> having been
left out as an anomaly, ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut lucus a non lucendo</span></i>‘: for the readers of
that paper roll their eyes in vain, and ‘find no dawn; but, in its
stead, total eclipse and ever-during dark surrounds them.’—But to
return from ‘the professional <em>gentleman</em>,’ as he calls himself, his
scavenger’s bell, his mud-cart of liberal phraseologies, and go-cart of
slavery and superstition, to something as different as genius from
dulness, as wit from malice, as sense from moon-struck madness, as
independence from servility, as the belles-lettres from law-stationery,
as Parnassus from Grub-street, or as the grub from the butterfly,—as
the man who winged his airy way from a Court which was unworthy
of him, and which would have made him unworthy of
himself, ‘as light as bird from brake,’ is from the man (if so he can
be called) who would grope his way there on all fours, bringing, as
the sacrifice best worthy of himself and of the place, his own dignity
of spirit and the rights of his fellow-creatures, to be trampled down
by the obscene hoofs of a base oligarchy. But we have already in
another place spoken our minds of that person, in a way to cut off
the communication between his ‘blind mouth’ and the Midas ears
of the Stock Exchange; and we do not wish to deprive him of a
livelihood. He may receive his Treasury wages for us, so that he
no longer levies them on public credulity, and we no longer confound
‘his sweet voice’ with that of the country or city, though it may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>echo the Court. The <cite>New Times</cite> is a nuisance; but it is not one
that requires to be abated. It speaks a plain, intelligible language.
Its principles are as palpable as they are base. Its pettifogging
pedantry and its Billingsgate slang can deceive nobody that is worth
undeceiving. It is the avowed organ of the deliberate, detestable
system which has long been covertly pursued in a certain quarter.
This paper raves aloud, under the ambiguous garb of phrenzy, what
its patrons think in secret. It proclaims on the house-tops what is
whispered in the high places. It soothes the ears of flatterers, of
tyrants, and of slaves,—but it sounds the alarm to free men. It is
so far a great public good. It tells the people of England what
is prepared for them, and what they have to expect. ‘Nothing is
sacred in its pages but tyranny.’ It links this country in chains of
vassalage to the legitimate despotisms of the Continent, which have
been a bye-word with us for ages. It binds this nation, hand and
foot, in the trammels of lasting servitude,—it puts the yoke upon our
necks as we put pack-saddles upon asses,—marks the brand upon
our foreheads as we ruddle over sheep,—binds us in ‘with shame,
with rotten parchments, and vile inky blots,’—makes England, that
threw off the yoke of a race of hereditary pretenders, shew ‘like
a rebel’s whore,’ and every morning illegitimates the House of
Brunswick, and strikes at the title of the Prince Regent to the succession
of the Crown, to which his ancestors had no just claim but the choice
of the people. It is not a paper for a free people to endure, if
a people that has oppressed the struggling liberties of another nation
can dare to call itself free; or for the Sovereign of a free people to
look at, if a Prince who had restored a despot to a throne, in contempt
of the voice of the people, could be supposed to respect the
rights of human nature more than his own power. It reverses the
Revolution of 1688, by justifying the claims of the Bourbons,—brings
back Popery and slavery here, by parity of reasoning,—and
sends the illustrious members of the present Royal Family a packing,
as vagabonds and outlaws—by <span class='fss'>RIGHT DIVINE</span>. If this is not a legitimate
conclusion from the Doctor’s reasoning,—from his ‘brangle and
brave-all, discord and debate,’—why then</p>

      <div class='line'>1807.</div>

<p class='c013'>Lord Chatham’s genius burnt brightest at the last. The spark
of liberty, which had lain concealed and dormant, buried under the
dirt and rubbish of state intrigue and vulgar faction, now met with
congenial matter, and kindled up ‘a flame of sacred vehemence’ in
his breast. It burst forth with a fury and a splendour that might
have awed the world, and made kings tremble. He spoke as a man
should speak, because he felt as a man should feel, in such circumstances.
He came forward as the advocate of liberty, as the
defender of the rights of his fellow-citizens, as the enemy of
tyranny, as the friend of his country, and of mankind. He did not
stand up to make a vain display of his talents, but to discharge a
duty, to maintain that cause which lay nearest to his heart, to
preserve the ark of the British constitution from every sacrilegious
touch, as the high-priest of his calling, with a pious zeal. The
feelings and the rights of Englishmen were enshrined in his heart;
and with their united force braced every nerve, possessed every faculty,
and communicated warmth and vital energy to every part of his
being. The whole man moved under this impulse. He felt the cause
of liberty as his own. He resented every injury done to her as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>injury to himself, and every attempt to defend it as an insult upon his
understanding. He did not stay to dispute about words, about nice
distinctions, about trifling forms. He laughed at the little attempts
of little retailers of logic to entangle him in senseless argument. He
did not come there as to a debating club, or law court, to start
questions and hunt them down; to wind and unwind the web of
sophistry; to pick out the threads, and untie every knot with
scrupulous exactness; to bandy logic with every pretender to a
paradox; to examine, to sift evidence; to dissect a doubt and halve
a scruple; to weigh folly and knavery in scales together, and see on
which side the balance preponderated; to prove that liberty, truth,
virtue, and justice were good things, or that slavery and corruption
were bad things. He did not try to prove those truths which did
not require any proof, but to make others feel them with the same
force that he did; and to tear off the flimsy disguises with which the
sycophants of power attempted to cover them.—The business of an
orator is not to convince, but persuade; not to inform, but to rouse the
mind; to build upon the habitual prejudices of mankind, (for reason
of itself will do nothing,) and to add feeling to prejudice, and action
to feeling. There is nothing new or curious or profound in Lord
Chatham’s speeches. All is obvious and common; there is nothing
but what we already knew, or might have found out for ourselves.
We see nothing but the familiar every-day face of nature. We are
always in broad day-light. But then there is the same difference
between our own conceptions of things and his representation of
them, as there is between the same objects seen on a dull cloudy day,
or in the blaze of sunshine. His common sense has the effect of
inspiration. He electrifies his hearers, not by the novelty of his
ideas, but by their force and intensity. He has the same ideas as
other men, but he has them in a thousand times greater clearness and
strength and vividness. Perhaps there is no man so poorly furnished
with thoughts and feelings but that if he could recollect all that he
knew, and had all his ideas at perfect command, he would be able to
confound the puny arts of the most dexterous sophist that pretended
to make a dupe of his understanding. But in the mind of Chatham,
the great substantial truths of common sense, the leading maxims of
the Constitution, the real interests and general feelings of mankind,
were in a manner embodied. He comprehended the whole of his
subject at a single glance—every thing was firmly rivetted to its
place; there was no feebleness, no forgetfulness, no pause, no distraction;
the ardour of his mind overcame every obstacle, and he
crushed the objections of his adversaries as we crush an insect under
our feet.—His imagination was of the same character with his understanding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>and was under the same guidance. Whenever he gave way
to it, it ‘flew an eagle flight, forth and right on’; but it did not
become enamoured of its own motion, wantoning in giddy circles, or
‘sailing with supreme dominion through the azure deep of air.’ It
never forgot its errand, but went strait forward, like an arrow to its
mark, with an unerring aim. It was his servant, not his master.</p>

<p class='c010'>To be a great orator does not require the highest faculties of the
human mind, but it requires the highest exertion of the common
faculties of our nature. He has no occasion to dive into the depths
of science, or to soar aloft on angels’ wings. He keeps upon the
surface, he stands firm upon the ground, but his form is majestic, and
his eye sees far and near: he moves among his fellows, but he moves
among them as a giant among common men. He has no need to
read the heavens, to unfold the system of the universe, or create new
worlds for the delighted fancy to dwell in; it is enough that he sees
things as they are; that he knows and feels and remembers the
common circumstances and daily transactions that are passing in the
world around him. He is not raised above others by being superior
to the common interests, prejudices, and passions of mankind, but by
feeling them in a more intense degree than they do. Force then is
the sole characteristic excellence of an orator; it is almost the only
one that can be of any service to him. Refinement, depth, elevation,
delicacy, originality, ingenuity, invention, are not wanted: he must
appeal to the sympathies of human nature, and whatever is not founded
in these, is foreign to his purpose. He does not create, he can only
imitate or echo back the public sentiment. His object is to call up
the feelings of the human breast; but he cannot call up what is not
already there. The first duty of an orator is to be understood by
every one; but it is evident that what all can understand, is not in
itself difficult of comprehension. He cannot add any thing to the
materials afforded him by the knowledge and experience of others.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lord Chatham, in his speeches, was neither philosopher nor poet.
As to the latter, the difference between poetry and eloquence I take
to be this: that the object of the one is to delight the imagination,
that of the other to impel the will. The one ought to enrich and
feed the mind itself with tenderness and beauty, the other furnishes it
with motives of action. The one seeks to give immediate pleasure,
to make the mind dwell with rapture on its own workings—it is to
itself ‘both end and use’: the other endeavours to call up such
images as will produce the strongest effect upon the mind, and makes
use of the passions only as instruments to attain a particular purpose.
The poet lulls and soothes the mind into a forgetfulness of itself, and
‘laps it in Elysium’: the orator strives to awaken it to a sense of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>real interests, and to make it feel the necessity of taking the most
effectual means for securing them. The one dwells in an ideal
world; the other is only conversant about realities. Hence poetry
must be more ornamented, must be richer and fuller and more
delicate, because it is at liberty to select whatever images are naturally
most beautiful, and likely to give most pleasure; whereas the orator
is confined to particular facts, which he may adorn as well as he can,
and make the most of, but which he cannot strain beyond a certain
point without running into extravagance and affectation, and losing his
end. However, from the very nature of the case, the orator is
allowed a greater latitude, and is compelled to make use of harsher
and more abrupt combinations in the decoration of his subject; for
his art is an attempt to reconcile beauty and deformity together:
on the contrary, the materials of poetry, which are chosen at pleasure,
are in themselves beautiful, and naturally combine with whatever else
is beautiful. Grace and harmony are therefore essential to poetry,
because they naturally arise out of the subject; but whatever adds to
the effect, whatever tends to strengthen the idea or give energy to the
mind, is of the nature of eloquence. The orator is only concerned
to give a tone of masculine firmness to the will, to brace the sinews
and muscles of the mind; not to delight our nervous sensibilities, or
soften the mind into voluptuous indolence. The flowery and sentimental
style is of all others the most intolerable in a speaker.—I
shall only add on this subject, that modesty, impartiality, and candour,
are not the virtues of a public speaker. He must be confident,
inflexible, uncontrolable, overcoming all opposition by his ardour and
impetuosity. We do not <em>command</em> others by sympathy with them,
but by power, by passion, by will. Calm inquiry, sober truth, and
speculative indifference will never carry any point. The passions are
contagious; and we cannot contend against opposite passions with
nothing but naked reason. Concessions to an enemy are clear loss:
he will take advantage of them, but make us none in return. He
will magnify the weak sides of our argument, but will be blind to
whatever makes against himself. The multitude will always be
inclined to side with that party, whose passions are the most inflamed,
and whose prejudices are the most inveterate. Passion should therefore
never be sacrificed to punctilio. It should indeed be governed
by prudence, but it should itself govern and lend its impulse and
direction to abstract reason. Fox was a reasoner, Lord Chatham
was an orator. Burke was both a reasoner and a poet; and was
therefore still farther removed from that conformity with the vulgar
notions and mechanical feelings of mankind, which will always be
necessary to give a man the chief sway in a popular assembly.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>
  <h3 class='c003'>CHARACTER OF MR. BURKE, 1807<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c011'><sup>[54]</sup></a></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The following speech is perhaps the fairest specimen I could give of
Mr. Burke’s various talents as a speaker. The subject itself is not
the most interesting, nor does it admit of that weight and closeness of
reasoning which he displayed on other occasions. But there is no
single speech which can convey a satisfactory idea of his powers of
mind: to do him justice, it would be necessary to quote all his
works; the only specimen of Burke is, <em>all that he wrote</em>. With
respect to most other speakers, a specimen is generally enough, or
more than enough. When you are acquainted with their manner,
and see what proficiency they have made in the mechanical exercise
of their profession, with what facility they can borrow a simile, or
round a period, how dexterously they can argue, and object, and
rejoin, you are satisfied; there is no other difference in their speeches
than what arises from the difference of the subjects. But this was
not the case with Burke. He brought his subjects along with him;
he drew his materials from himself. The only limits which circumscribed
his variety were the stores of his own mind. His stock of
ideas did not consist of a few meagre facts, meagrely stated, of half a
dozen common-places tortured in a thousand different ways: but his
mine of wealth was a profound understanding, inexhaustible as the
human heart, and various as the sources of nature. He therefore
enriched every subject to which he applied himself, and new subjects
were only the occasions of calling forth fresh powers of mind which
had not been before exerted. It would therefore be in vain to look
for the proof of his powers in any one of his speeches or writings:
they all contain some additional proof of power. In speaking of
Burke, then, I shall speak of the whole compass and circuit of his
mind—not of that small part or section of him which I have been
able to give: to do otherwise would be like the story of the man who
put the brick in his pocket, thinking to shew it as the model of a
house. I have been able to manage pretty well with respect to all
my other speakers, and curtailed them down without remorse. It
was easy to reduce them within certain limits, to fix their spirit, and
condense their variety; by having a certain quantity given, you might
infer all the rest; it was only the same thing over again. But who
can bind Proteus, or confine the roving flight of genius?</p>

<p class='c010'>Burke’s writings are better than his speeches, and indeed his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>speeches are writings. But he seemed to feel himself more at ease,
to have a fuller possession of his faculties in addressing the public,
than in addressing the House of Commons. Burke was <em>raised</em> into
public life: and he seems to have been prouder of this new dignity
than became so great a man. For this reason, most of his speeches
have a sort of parliamentary preamble to them: there is an air of
affected modesty, and ostentatious trifling in them: he seems fond of
coqueting with the House of Commons, and is perpetually calling the
Speaker out to dance a minuet with him, before he begins. There is
also something like an attempt to stimulate the superficial dulness of
his hearers by exciting their surprise, by running into extravagance:
and he sometimes demeans himself by condescending to what may be
considered as bordering too much upon buffoonery, for the amusement
of the company. Those lines of Milton were admirably applied to
him by some one—‘The elephant to make them sport wreathed his
proboscis lithe.’ The truth is, that he was out of his place in the
House of Commons; he was eminently qualified to shine as a man of
genius, as the instructor of mankind, as the brightest luminary of his
age: but he had nothing in common with that motley crew of knights,
citizens, and burgesses. He could not be said to be ‘native and
endued unto that element.’ He was above it; and never appeared
like himself, but when, forgetful of the idle clamours of party, and of
the little views of little men, he appealed to his country, and the
enlightened judgment of mankind.</p>

<p class='c010'>I am not going to make an idle panegyric on Burke (he has no
need of it); but I cannot help looking upon him as the chief boast
and ornament of the English House of Commons. What has been
said of him is, I think, strictly true, that ‘he was the most eloquent
man of his time: his wisdom was greater than his eloquence.’ The
only public man that in my opinion can be put in any competition
with him, is Lord Chatham: and he moved in a sphere so very
remote, that it is almost impossible to compare them. But though it
would perhaps be difficult to determine which of them excelled most
in his particular way, there is nothing in the world more easy than to
point out in what their peculiar excellences consisted. They were in
every respect the reverse of each other. Chatham’s eloquence was
popular: his wisdom was altogether plain and practical. Burke’s
eloquence was that of the poet; of the man of high and unbounded
fancy: his wisdom was profound and contemplative. Chatham’s
eloquence was calculated to make men <em>act</em>; Burke’s was calculated to
make them <em>think</em>. Chatham could have roused the fury of a multitude,
and wielded their physical energy as he pleased: Burke’s eloquence
carried conviction into the mind of the retired and lonely student,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>opened the recesses of the human breast, and lighted up the face of
nature around him. Chatham supplied his hearers with motives to
immediate action: Burke furnished them with <em>reasons</em> for action
which might have little effect upon them at the time, but for which
they would be the wiser and better all their lives after. In research,
in originality, in variety of knowledge, in richness of invention, in
depth and comprehension of mind, Burke had as much the advantage
of Lord Chatham as he was excelled by him in plain common sense,
in strong feeling, in steadiness of purpose, in vehemence, in warmth,
in enthusiasm, and energy of mind. Burke was the man of genius,
of fine sense, and subtle reasoning; Chatham was a man of clear
understanding, of strong sense, and violent passions. Burke’s mind
was satisfied with speculation: Chatham’s was essentially <em>active</em>: it
could not rest without an object. The power which governed Burke’s
mind was his Imagination; that which gave its <em>impetus</em> to Chatham’s
was Will. The one was almost the creature of pure intellect, the
other of physical temperament.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are two very different ends which a man of genius may
propose to himself either in writing or speaking, and which will
accordingly give birth to very different styles. He can have but one
of these two objects; either to enrich or strengthen the mind; either
to furnish us with new ideas, to lead the mind into new trains of
thought, to which it was before unused, and which it was incapable
of striking out for itself; or else to collect and embody what we
already knew, to rivet our old impressions more deeply; to make
what was before plain still plainer, and to give to that which was
familiar all the effect of novelty. In the one case we receive an
accession to the stock of our ideas; in the other, an additional
degree of life and energy is infused into them: our thoughts continue
to flow in the same channels, but their pulse is quickened and invigorated.
I do not know how to distinguish these different styles better
than by calling them severally the inventive and refined, or the
impressive and vigorous styles. It is only the subject-matter of
eloquence, however, which is allowed to be remote or obscure. The
things in themselves may be subtle and recondite, but they must be
dragged out of their obscurity and brought struggling to the light;
they must be rendered plain and palpable, (as far as it is in the wit of
man to do so) or they are no longer eloquence. That which by its
natural impenetrability, and in spite of every effort, remains dark and
difficult, which is impervious to every ray, on which the imagination
can shed no lustre, which can be clothed with no beauty, is not a
subject for the orator or poet. At the same time it cannot be
expected that abstract truths or profound observations should ever be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>placed in the same strong and dazzling points of view as natural objects
and mere matters of fact. It is enough if they receive a reflex and
borrowed lustre, like that which cheers the first dawn of morning,
where the effect of surprise and novelty gilds every object, and the
joy of beholding another world gradually emerging out of the gloom
of night, ‘a new creation rescued from his reign,’ fills the mind with
a sober rapture. Philosophical eloquence is in writing what <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro
scuro</span></i> is in painting; he would be a fool who should object that the
colours in the shaded part of a picture were not so bright as those on
the opposite side; the eye of the connoisseur receives an equal
delight from both, balancing the want of brilliancy and effect with
the greater delicacy of the tints, and difficulty of the execution.
In judging of Burke, therefore, we are to consider first the style
of eloquence which he adopted, and secondly the effects which he
produced with it. If he did not produce the same effects on vulgar
minds, as some others have done, it was not for want of power, but
from the turn and direction of his mind.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c011'><sup>[55]</sup></a> It was because his
subjects, his ideas, his arguments, were less vulgar. The question
is not whether he brought certain truths equally home to us, but how
much nearer he brought them than they were before. In my opinion,
he united the two extremes of refinement and strength in a higher
degree than any other writer whatever.</p>

<p class='c010'>The subtlety of his mind was undoubtedly that which rendered
Burke a less popular writer and speaker than he otherwise would
have been. It weakened the impression of his observations upon
others, but I cannot admit that it weakened the observations
themselves; that it took any thing from their real weight and
solidity. Coarse minds think all that is subtle, futile: that because
it is not gross and obvious and palpable to the senses, it is therefore
light and frivolous, and of no importance in the real affairs of life;
thus making their own confined understandings the measure of
truth, and supposing that whatever they do not distinctly perceive, is
nothing. Seneca, who was not one of the vulgar, also says, that
subtle truths are those which have the least substance in them, and
consequently approach nearest to non-entity. But for my own part I
cannot help thinking that the most important truths must be the most
refined and subtle; for that very reason, that they must comprehend
a great number of particulars, and instead of referring to any distinct
or positive fact, must point out the combined effects of an extensive
chain of causes, operating gradually, remotely, and collectively, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>therefore imperceptibly. General principles are not the less true or
important because from their nature they elude immediate observation;
they are like the air, which is not the less necessary because
we neither see nor feel it, or like that secret influence which binds
the world together, and holds the planets in their orbits. The very
same persons who are the most forward to laugh at all systematic
reasoning as idle and impertinent, you will the next moment hear
exclaiming bitterly against the baleful effects of new-fangled systems
of philosophy, or gravely descanting on the immense importance of
instilling sound principles of morality into the mind. It would not
be a bold conjecture, but an obvious truism to say, that all the great
changes which have been brought about in the moral world, either
for the better or worse, have been introduced not by the bare statement
of facts, which are things already known, and which must
always operate nearly in the same manner, but by the development of
certain opinions and abstract principles of reasoning on life and
manners, on the origin of society and man’s nature in general, which
being obscure and uncertain, vary from time to time, and produce
correspondent changes in the human mind. They are the wholesome
dew and rain, or the mildew and pestilence that silently destroy.
To this principle of generalization all religious creeds, the institutions
of wise law-givers, and the systems of philosophers, owe their
influence.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has always been with me a test of the sense and candour of
any one belonging to the opposite party, whether he allowed Burke
to be a great man. Of all the persons of this description that I have
ever known, I never met with above one or two who would make
this concession; whether it was that party feelings ran too high to
admit of any real candour, or whether it was owing to an essential
vulgarity in their habits of thinking, they all seemed to be of opinion
that he was a wild enthusiast, or a hollow sophist, who was to be
answered by bits of facts, by smart logic, by shrewd questions, and
idle songs. They looked upon him as a man of disordered intellects,
because he reasoned in a style to which they had not been used and
which confounded their dim perceptions. If you said that though
you differed with him in sentiment, yet you thought him an admirable
reasoner, and a close observer of human nature, you were answered
with a loud laugh, and some hackneyed quotation. ‘Alas! Leviathan
was not so tamed!’ They did not know whom they had to
contend with. The corner stone, which the builders rejected, became
the head-corner, though to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the
Greeks foolishness; for indeed I cannot discover that he was much
better understood by those of his own party, if we may judge from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>the little affinity there is between his mode of reasoning and theirs.—The
simple clue to all his reasonings on politics is, I think, as follows.
He did not agree with some writers, that that mode of government is
necessarily the best which is the cheapest. He saw in the construction
of society other principles at work, and other capacities of
fulfilling the desires, and perfecting the nature of man, besides those
of securing the equal enjoyment of the means of animal life, and
doing this at as little expense as possible. He thought that the
wants and happiness of men were not to be provided for, as we
provide for those of a herd of cattle, merely by attending to their
physical necessities. He thought more nobly of his fellows. He
knew that man had affections and passions and powers of imagination,
as well as hunger and thirst and the sense of heat and cold. He
took his idea of political society from the pattern of private life,
wishing, as he himself expresses it, to incorporate the domestic
charities with the orders of the state, and to blend them together.
He strove to establish an analogy between the compact that binds
together the community at large, and that which binds together the
several families that compose it. He knew that the rules that form the
basis of private morality are not founded in reason, that is, in the
abstract properties of those things which are the subjects of them, but
in the nature of man, and his capacity of being affected by certain
things from habit, from imagination, and sentiment, as well as from
reason.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus, the reason why a man ought to be attached to his wife
and children is not, surely, that they are better than others, (for in
this case every one else ought to be of the same opinion) but
because he must be chiefly interested in those things which are
nearest to him, and with which he is best acquainted, since his
understanding cannot reach equally to every thing; because he must
be most attached to those objects which he has known the longest,
and which by their situation have actually affected him the most, not
those which in themselves are the most affecting, whether they have
ever made any impression on him or no; that is, because he is by
his nature the creature of habit and feeling, and because it is reasonable
that he should act in conformity to his nature. Burke was so
far right in saying that it is no objection to an institution, that it is
founded in <em>prejudice</em>, but the contrary, if that prejudice is natural and
right; that is, if it arises from those circumstances which are
properly subjects of feeling and association, not from any defect or
perversion of the understanding in those things which fall strictly
under its jurisdiction. On this profound maxim he took his stand.
Thus he contended, that the prejudice in favour of nobility was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>natural and proper, and fit to be encouraged by the positive institutions
of society; not on account of the real or personal merit of the
individuals, but because such an institution has a tendency to enlarge
and raise the mind, to keep alive the memory of past greatness, to
connect the different ages of the world together, to carry back the
imagination over a long tract of time, and feed it with the contemplation
of remote events: because it is natural to think highly of
that which inspires us with high thoughts, which has been connected
for many generations with splendour, and affluence, and dignity, and
power, and privilege. He also conceived, that by transferring the
respect from the person to the thing, and thus rendering it steady and
permanent, the mind would be habitually formed to sentiments of
deference, attachment, and fealty, to whatever else demanded its
respect: that it would be led to fix its view on what was elevated
and lofty, and be weaned from that low and narrow jealousy which
never willingly or heartily admits of any superiority in others, and is
glad of every opportunity to bring down all excellence to a level with
its own miserable standard. Nobility did not therefore exist to the
prejudice of the other orders of the state, but by, and for them.
The inequality of the different orders of society did not destroy the
unity and harmony of the whole. The health and well-being of the
moral world was to be promoted by the same means as the beauty of
the natural world; by contrast, by change, by light and shade, by
variety of parts, by order and proportion. To think of reducing all
mankind to the same insipid level, seemed to him the same absurdity
as to destroy the inequalities of surface in a country, for the benefit of
agriculture and commerce. In short, he believed that the interests
of men in society should be consulted, and their several stations and
employments assigned, with a view to their nature, not as physical,
but as moral beings, so as to nourish their hopes, to lift their imagination,
to enliven their fancy, to rouse their activity, to strengthen
their virtue, and to furnish the greatest number of objects of pursuit
and means of enjoyment to beings constituted as man is, consistently
with the order and stability of the whole.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same reasoning might be extended farther. I do not say that
his arguments are conclusive; but they are profound and <em>true</em>, as far
as they go. There may be disadvantages and abuses necessarily interwoven
with his scheme, or opposite advantages of infinitely greater value,
to be derived from another order of things and state of society. This
however does not invalidate either the truth or importance of Burke’s
reasoning; since the advantages he points out as connected with the
mixed form of government are really and necessarily inherent in it:
since they are compatible in the same degree with no other; since the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>principle itself on which he rests his argument (whatever we may
think of the application) is of the utmost weight and moment; and
since on whichever side the truth lies, it is impossible to make a fair
decision without having the opposite side of the question clearly and
fully stated to us. This Burke has done in a masterly manner. He
presents to you one view or face of society. Let him, who thinks he
can, give the reverse side with equal force, beauty, and clearness. It
is said, I know, that truth is <em>one</em>; but to this I cannot subscribe, for
it appears to me that truth is <em>many</em>. There are as many truths as
there are things and causes of action and contradictory principles at
work in society. In making up the account of good and evil, indeed,
the final result must be one way or the other; but the particulars on
which that result depends are infinite and various.</p>

<p class='c010'>It will be seen from what I have said, that I am very far from
agreeing with those who think that Burke was a man without understanding,
and a merely florid writer. There are two causes which
have given rise to this calumny; namely, that narrowness of mind
which leads men to suppose that the truth lies entirely on the side of
their own opinions, and that whatever does not make for them is
absurd and irrational; secondly, a trick we have of confounding
reason with judgment, and supposing that it is merely the province
of the understanding to pronounce sentence, and not to give in
evidence, or argue the case; in short, that it is a passive, not an
active faculty. Thus there are persons who never run into any
extravagance, because they are so buttressed up with the opinions of
others on all sides, that they cannot lean much to one side or the
other; they are so little moved with any kind of reasoning, that they
remain at an equal distance from every extreme, and are never very
far from the truth, because the slowness of their faculties will not
suffer them to make much progress in error. These are persons of
great judgment. The scales of the mind are pretty sure to remain
even, when there is nothing in them. In this sense of the word,
Burke must be allowed to have wanted judgment, by all those who
think that he was wrong in his conclusions. The accusation of want
of judgment, in fact, only means that you yourself are of a different
opinion. But if in arriving at one error he discovered a hundred
truths, I should consider myself a hundred times more indebted
to him than if, stumbling on that which I consider as the right
side of the question, he had committed a hundred absurdities in
striving to establish his point. I speak of him now merely as an
author, or as far as I and other readers are concerned with him;
at the same time, I should not differ from any one who may be
disposed to contend that the consequences of his writings as instruments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>of political power have been tremendous, fatal, such as
no exertion of wit or knowledge or genius can ever counteract or
atone for.</p>

<p class='c010'>Burke also gave a hold to his antagonists by mixing up sentiments
and imagery with his reasoning; so that being unused to such a sight
in the region of politics, they were deceived, and could not discern
the fruit from the flowers. Gravity is the cloke of wisdom; and
those who have nothing else think it an insult to affect the one without
the other, because it destroys the only foundation on which their
pretensions are built. The easiest part of reason is dulness; the
generality of the world are therefore concerned in discouraging any
example of unnecessary brilliancy that might tend to shew that the
two things do not always go together. Burke in some measure
dissolved the spell. It was discovered, that his gold was not the
less valuable for being wrought into elegant shapes, and richly embossed
with curious figures; that the solidity of a building is not
destroyed by adding to it beauty and ornament; and that the strength
of a man’s understanding is not always to be estimated in exact proportion
to his want of imagination. His understanding was not the
less real, because it was not the only faculty he possessed. He
justified the description of the poet,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘How charming is divine philosophy!</div>
      <div class='line'>Not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose,</div>
      <div class='line'>But musical as is Apollo’s lute!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Those who object to this union of grace and beauty with reason,
are in fact weak-sighted people, who cannot distinguish the noble
and majestic form of Truth from that of her sister Folly, if they
are dressed both alike! But there is always a difference even in
the adventitious ornaments they wear, which is sufficient to distinguish
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Burke was so far from being a gaudy or flowery writer, that
he was one of the severest writers we have. His words are the
most like things; his style is the most strictly suited to the subject.
He unites every extreme and every variety of composition; the lowest
and the meanest words and descriptions with the highest. He
exults in the display of power, in shewing the extent, the force,
and intensity of his ideas; he is led on by the mere impulse and
vehemence of his fancy, not by the affectation of dazzling his readers
by gaudy conceits or pompous images. He was completely carried
away by his subject. He had no other object but to produce the
strongest impression on his reader, by giving the truest, the most
characteristic, the fullest, and most forcible descriptions of things,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>trusting to the power of his own mind to mould them into grace and
beauty. He did not produce a splendid effect by setting fire to the
light vapours that float in the regions of fancy, as the chemists make
fine colours with phosphorus, but by the eagerness of his blows struck
fire from the flint, and melted the hardest substances in the furnace of
his imagination. The wheels of his imagination did not catch fire
from the rottenness of the materials, but from the rapidity of their
motion. One would suppose, to hear people talk of Burke, that his
style was such as would have suited the ‘Lady’s Magazine’; soft,
smooth, showy, tender, insipid, full of fine words, without any
meaning. The essence of the gaudy or glittering style consists in
producing a momentary effect by fine words and images brought
together, without order or connexion. Burke most frequently
produced an effect by the remoteness and novelty of his combinations,
by the force of contrast, by the striking manner in which the most
opposite and unpromising materials were harmoniously blended
together; not by laying his hands on all the fine things he could
think of, but by bringing together those things which he knew would
blaze out into glorious light by their collision. The florid style is
a mixture of affectation and common-place. Burke’s was an union of
untameable vigour and originality.</p>

<p class='c010'>Burke was not a verbose writer. If he sometimes multiplies
words, it is not for want of ideas, but because there are no words
that fully express his ideas, and he tries to do it as well as he can by
different ones. He had nothing of the <em>set</em> or formal style, the
measured cadence, and stately phraseology of Johnson, and most of
our modern writers. This style, which is what we understand by
the <em>artificial</em>, is all in one key. It selects a certain set of words to
represent all ideas whatever, as the most dignified and elegant, and
excludes all others as low and vulgar. The words are not fitted to
the things, but the things to the words. Every thing is seen through
a false medium. It is putting a mask on the face of nature, which
may indeed hide some specks and blemishes, but takes away all
beauty, delicacy, and variety. It destroys all dignity or elevation,
because nothing can be raised where all is on a level, and completely
destroys all force, expression, truth, and character, by arbitrarily
confounding the differences of things, and reducing every thing to the
same insipid standard. To suppose that this stiff uniformity can add
any thing to real grace or dignity, is like supposing that the human
body in order to be perfectly graceful, should never deviate from its
upright posture. Another mischief of this method is, that it confounds
all ranks in literature. Where there is no room for variety,
no discrimination, no nicety to be shewn in matching the idea with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>its proper word, there can be no room for taste or elegance. A man
must easily learn the art of writing, when every sentence is to be cast
in the same mould: where he is only allowed the use of one word,
he cannot choose wrong, nor will he be in much danger of making
himself ridiculous by affectation or false glitter, when, whatever
subject he treats of, he must treat of it in the same way. This indeed
is to wear golden chains for the sake of ornament.</p>

<p class='c010'>Burke was altogether free from the pedantry which I have here
endeavoured to expose. His style was as original, as expressive, as
rich and varied, as it was possible; his combinations were as exquisite,
as playful, as happy, as unexpected, as bold and daring, as his fancy.
If any thing, he ran into the opposite extreme of too great an
inequality, if truth and nature could ever be carried to an extreme.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those who are best acquainted with the writings and speeches of
Burke will not think the praise I have here bestowed on them
exaggerated. Some proof will be found of this in the following
extracts. But the full proof must be sought in his works at large, and
particularly in the ‘Thoughts on the Discontents’; in his ‘Reflections
on the French Revolution’; in his ‘Letter to the Duke of
Bedford’; and in the ‘Regicide Peace.’ The two last of these are
perhaps the most remarkable of all his writings, from the contrast they
afford to each other. The one is the most delightful exhibition of
wild and brilliant fancy, that is to be found in English prose, but it is
too much like a beautiful picture painted upon gauze; it wants something
to support it: the other is without ornament, but it has all the
solidity, the weight, the gravity of a judicial record. It seems to
have been written with a certain constraint upon himself, and to shew
those who said he could not <em>reason</em>, that his arguments might be
stripped of their ornaments without losing any thing of their force. It
is certainly, of all his works, that in which he has shewn most power
of logical deduction, and the only one in which he has made any
important use of facts. In general he certainly paid little attention to
them: they were the playthings of his mind. He saw them as he
pleased, not as they were; with the eye of the philosopher or the
poet, regarding them only in their general principle, or as they might
serve to decorate his subject. This is the natural consequence of
much imagination: things that are probable are elevated into the rank
of realities. To those who can reason on the essences of things, or
who can invent according to nature, the experimental proof is of little
value. This was the case with Burke. In the present instance,
however, he seems to have forced his mind into the service of facts:
and he succeeded completely. His comparison between our connexion
with France or Algiers, and his account of the conduct of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>war, are as clear, as convincing, as forcible examples of this kind of
reasoning, as are any where to be met with. Indeed I do not think
there is any thing in Fox (whose mind was purely historical) or in
Chatham, (who attended to feelings more than facts) that will bear a
comparison with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Burke has been compared to Cicero—I do not know for what
reason. Their excellences are as different, and indeed as opposite, as
they well can be. Burke had not the polished elegance; the glossy
neatness, the artful regularity, the exquisite modulation of Cicero: he
had a thousand times more richness and originality of mind, more
strength and pomp of diction.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been well observed, that the ancients had no word that
properly expresses what we mean by the word <em>genius</em>. They perhaps
had not the thing. Their minds appear to have been too exact, too
retentive, too minute and subtle, too sensible to the external differences
of things, too passive under their impressions, to admit of those bold
and rapid combinations, those lofty flights of fancy, which, glancing
from heaven to earth, unite the most opposite extremes, and draw the
happiest illustrations from things the most remote. Their ideas were
kept too confined and distinct by the material form or vehicle in which
they were conveyed, to unite cordially together, or be melted down
in the imagination. Their metaphors are taken from things of the
same class, not from things of different classes; the general analogy
not the individual feeling, directs them in their choice. Hence, as
Dr. Johnson observed, their similes are either repetitions of the same
idea, or so obvious and general as not to lend any additional force to
it; as when a huntress is compared to Diana, or a warrior rushing into
battle to a lion rushing on his prey. Their <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> was exquisite art
and perfect imitation. Witness their statues and other things of the
same kind. But they had not that high and enthusiastic fancy which
some of our own writers have shewn. For the proof of this, let any
one compare Milton and Shakspeare with Homer and Sophocles, or
Burke with Cicero.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be asked whether Burke was a poet. He was so only in
the general vividness of his fancy, and in richness of invention.
There may be poetical passages in his works, but I certainly think
that his writings in general are quite distinct from poetry; and that
for the reason before given, namely, that the subject-matter of them is
not poetical. The finest parts of them are illustrations or personifications
of dry abstract ideas;<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c011'><sup>[56]</sup></a> and the union between the idea and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>illustration is not of that perfect and pleasing kind as to constitute
poetry, or indeed to be admissible, but for the effect intended to be
produced by it; that is, by every means in our power to give animation
and attraction to subjects in themselves barren of ornament, but
which at the same time are pregnant with the most important
consequences, and in which the understanding and the passions are
equally interested.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have heard it remarked by a person, to whose opinion I would
sooner submit than to a general council of critics, that the sound of
Burke’s prose is not musical; that it wants cadence; and that instead
of being so lavish of his imagery as is generally supposed, he seemed
to him to be rather parsimonious in the use of it, always expanding
and making the most of his ideas. This may be true if we compare
him with some of our poets, or perhaps with some of our early prose
writers, but not if we compare him with any of our political writers
or parliamentary speakers. There are some very fine things of Lord
Bolingbroke’s on the same subjects, but not equal to Burke’s. As for
Junius, he is at the head of his class; but that class is not the highest.
He has been said to have more dignity than Burke. Yes—if the
stalk of a giant is less dignified than the strut of a <em>petit-maître</em>. I do
not mean to speak disrespectfully of Junius, but grandeur is not the
character of his composition; and if it is not to be found in Burke, it
is to be found nowhere.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHARACTER OF MR. FOX, 1807<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c011'><sup>[57]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c008'>I shall begin with observing generally, that Mr. Fox excelled all his
contemporaries in the extent of his knowledge, in the clearness and
distinctness of his views, in quickness of apprehension, in plain,
practical common sense, in the full, strong, and absolute possession of
his subject. A measure was no sooner proposed than he seemed to
have an instantaneous and intuitive perception of its various bearings
and consequences; of the manner in which it would operate on the
different classes of society, on commerce or agriculture, on our
domestic or foreign policy; of the difficulties attending its execution;
in a word, of all its practical results, and the comparative advantages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>to be gained either by adopting or rejecting it. He was intimately
acquainted with the interests of the different parts of the community,
with the minute and complicated details of political economy, with
our external relations, with the views, the resources, and the maxims
of other states. He was master of all those facts and circumstances
which it was necessary to know in order to judge fairly and determine
wisely; and he knew them not loosely or lightly, but in number,
weight, and measure. He had also stored his memory by reading
and general study, and improved his understanding by the lamp of
history. He was well acquainted with the opinions and sentiments
of the best authors, with the maxims of the most profound politicians,
with the causes of the rise and fall of states, with the general passions
of men, with the characters of different nations, and the laws and
constitution of his own country. He was a man of a large, capacious,
powerful, and highly cultivated intellect. No man could know more
than he knew; no man’s knowledge could be more sound, more plain
and useful; no man’s knowledge could lie in more connected and
tangible masses; no man could be more perfectly master of his ideas,
could reason upon them more closely, or decide upon them more
impartially. His mind was full, even to overflowing. He was so
habitually conversant with the most intricate and comprehensive trains
of thought, or such was the natural vigour and exuberance of his mind,
that he seemed to recal them without any effort. His ideas quarrelled
for utterance. So far from ever being at a loss for them, he was
obliged rather to repress and rein them in, lest they should overwhelm
and confound, instead of informing the understandings of his hearers.</p>

<p class='c010'>If to this we add the ardour and natural impetuosity of his mind,
his quick sensibility, his eagerness in the defence of truth, and his
impatience of every thing that looked like trick or artifice or affectation,
we shall be able in some measure to account for the character of
his eloquence. His thoughts came crowding in too fast for the slow
and mechanical process of speech. What he saw in an instant, he
could only express imperfectly, word by word, and sentence after
sentence. He would, if he could, ‘have bared his swelling heart,’
and laid open at once the rich treasures of knowledge with which his
bosom was fraught. It is no wonder that this difference between the
rapidity of his feelings, and the formal round-about method of communicating
them, should produce some disorder in his frame; that the
throng of his ideas should try to overleap the narrow boundaries which
confined them, and tumultuously break down their prison-doors,
instead of waiting to be let out one by one, and following patiently
at due intervals and with mock dignity, like poor dependents, in the
train of words:—that he should express himself in hurried sentences,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>in involuntary exclamations, by vehement gestures, by sudden starts
and bursts of passion. Every thing shewed the agitation of his mind.
His tongue faltered, his voice became almost suffocated, and his face
was bathed in tears. He was lost in the magnitude of his subject.
He reeled and staggered under the load of feeling which oppressed
him. He rolled like the sea beaten by a tempest.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c011'><sup>[58]</sup></a> Whoever, having
the feelings of a man, compared him at these times with his boasted
rival,—his stiff, straight, upright figure, his gradual contortions,
turning round as if moved by a pivot, his solemn pauses, his deep
tones, ‘whose sound reverbed their own hollowness,’ must have said,
This is a man; that is an automaton. If Fox had needed grace,
he would have had it; but it was not the character of his mind, nor
would it have suited with the style of his eloquence. It was Pitt’s
object to smooth over the abruptness and intricacies of his argument
by the gracefulness of his manner, and to fix the attention of his
hearers on the pomp and sound of his words. Lord Chatham, again,
strove to <em>command</em> others; he did not try to convince them, but to
overpower their understandings by the greater strength and vehemence
of his own; to awe them by a sense of personal superiority: and he
therefore was obliged to assume a lofty and dignified manner. It was
to him they bowed, not to truth; and whatever related to <em>himself</em>,
must therefore have a tendency to inspire respect and admiration.
Indeed, he would never have attempted to gain that ascendant over
men’s minds that he did, if either his mind or body had been different
from what they were; if his temper had not urged him to control
and command others, or if his personal advantages had not enabled
him to secure that kind of authority which he coveted. But it would
have been ridiculous in Fox to have affected either the smooth
plausibility, the stately gravity of the one, or the proud, domineering,
imposing dignity of the other; or even if he could have succeeded, it
would only have injured the effect of his speeches.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c011'><sup>[59]</sup></a> What he had to
rely on was the strength, the solidity of his ideas, his complete and
thorough knowledge of his subject. It was his business therefore to
fix the attention of his hearers, not on himself, but on his subject; to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>rivet it there, to hurry it on from words to things:—the only circumstance
of which they required to be convinced with respect to himself,
was the sincerity of his opinions; and this would be best done by the
earnestness of his manner, by giving a loose to his feelings, and by
shewing the most perfect forgetfulness of himself, and of what others
thought of him. The moment a man shews you either by affected
words or looks or gestures, that he is thinking of himself, and you,
that he is trying either to please or terrify you into compliance, there
is an end at once to that kind of eloquence which owes its effect to
the force of truth, and to your confidence in the sincerity of the
speaker. It was, however, to the confidence inspired by the earnestness
and simplicity of his manner, that Mr. Fox was indebted for more
than half the effect of his speeches. Some others (as Lord Lansdown
for instance) might possess nearly as much information, as exact a
knowledge of the situation and interests of the country; but they wanted
that zeal, that animation, that enthusiasm, that deep sense of the
importance of the subject, which removes all doubt or suspicion from
the minds of the hearers and communicates its own warmth to every
breast. We may convince by argument alone; but it is by the interest
we discover in the success of our reasonings, that we persuade others
to feel and act with us. There are two circumstances which Fox’s
speeches and Lord Chatham’s had in common: they are alike distinguished
by a kind of plain downright common sense, and by the
vehemence of their manner. But still there is a great difference
between them, in both these respects. Fox in his opinions was
governed by facts—Chatham was more influenced by the feelings of
others respecting those facts. Fox endeavoured to find out what the
consequences of any measure would be; Chatham attended more to
what people would think of it. Fox appealed to the practical reason
of mankind; Chatham to popular prejudice. The one repelled the
encroachments of power by supplying his hearers with arguments
against it; the other by rousing their passions and arming their resentment
against those who would rob them of their birthright. Their
vehemence and impetuosity arose also from very different feelings.
In Chatham it was pride, passion, self-will, impatience of control, a
determination to have his own way, to carry every thing before him<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c011'><sup>[60]</sup></a>;
in Fox it was pure good nature, a sincere love of truth, an ardent
attachment to what he conceived to be right; an anxious concern for
the welfare and liberties of mankind. Or if we suppose that ambition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>had taken a strong hold of both their minds, yet their ambition was
of a very different kind: in the one it was the love of power, in the
other it was the love of fame. Nothing can be more opposite than
these two principles, both in their origin and tendency. The one
originates in a selfish, haughty, domineering spirit; the other in a
social and generous sensibility, desirous of the love and esteem of
others, and anxiously bent upon gaining merited applause. The one
grasps at immediate power by any means within its reach; the other,
if it does not square its actions by the rules of virtue, at least refers
them to a standard which comes the nearest to it—the disinterested
applause of our country, and the enlightened judgment of posterity.
The love of fame is consistent with the steadiest attachment to
principle, and indeed strengthens and supports it; whereas the love
of power, where this is the ruling passion, requires the sacrifice of
principle at every turn, and is inconsistent even with the shadow of it.
I do not mean to say that Fox had no love of power, or Chatham no
love of fame, (this would be reversing all we know of human nature,)
but that the one principle predominated in the one, and the other in
the other. My reader will do me great injustice if he supposes that
in attempting to describe the characters of different speakers by contrasting
their general qualities, I mean any thing beyond the <em>more</em> or
<em>less</em>: but it is necessary to describe those qualities simply and in the
abstract, in order to make the distinction intelligible. Chatham
resented any attack made upon the cause of liberty, of which he was
the avowed champion, as an indignity offered to himself. Fox felt
it as a stain upon the honour of his country, and as an injury to the
rights of his fellow citizens. The one was swayed by his own
passions and purposes, with very little regard to the consequences; the
sensibility of the other was roused, and his passions kindled into a
generous flame, by a real interest in whatever related to the welfare
of mankind, and by an intense and earnest contemplation of the consequences
of the measures he opposed. It was this union of the zeal
of the patriot with the enlightened knowledge of the statesman, that
gave to the eloquence of Fox its more than mortal energy; that
warmed, expanded, penetrated every bosom. He relied on the force
of truth and nature alone; the refinements of philosophy, the pomp
and pageantry of the imagination were forgotten, or seemed light and
frivolous; the fate of nations, the welfare of millions, hung suspended
as he spoke; a torrent of manly eloquence poured from his heart,
bore down every thing in its course, and surprised into a momentary
sense of human feeling the breathing corpses, the wire-moved puppets,
the stuffed figures, the flexible machinery, the ‘deaf and dumb
things’ of a court.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>I find (I do not know how the reader feels) that it is difficult
to write a character of Fox without running into insipidity or extravagance.
And the reason of this is, there are no splendid
contrasts, no striking irregularities, no curious distinctions to work
upon; no ‘jutting frieze, buttress, nor coigne of ‘vantage,’ for the
imagination to take hold of. It was a plain marble slab, inscribed
in plain legible characters, without either hieroglyphics or carving.
There was the same directness and manly simplicity in every thing
that he did. The whole of his character may indeed be summed
up in two words—strength and simplicity. Fox was in the class
of common men, but he was the first in that class. Though it is
easy to describe the difference of things, nothing is more difficult
than to describe their degrees or quantities. In what I am going
to say, I hope I shall not be suspected of a design to underrate
his powers of mind, when in fact I am only trying to ascertain
their nature and direction. The degree and extent to which he
possessed them can only be known by reading, or indeed by having
heard his speeches.</p>

<p class='c010'>His mind, as I have already said, was, I conceive, purely <em>historical</em>:
and having said this, I have I believe said all. But perhaps it will
be necessary to explain a little farther what I mean. I mean, then,
that his memory was in an extraordinary degree tenacious of facts;
that they were crowded together in his mind without the least perplexity
or confusion; that there was no chain of consequences too
vast for his powers of comprehension; that the different parts and
ramifications of his subject were never so involved and intricate but
that they were easily disentangled in the clear prism of his understanding.
The basis of his wisdom was experience: however, he
not only knew what had happened; but by an exact knowledge of the
real state of things, he could always tell what in the common course
of events would happen in future. The force of his mind was exerted
upon facts: as long as he could lean directly upon these, as long as
he had the actual objects to refer to, to steady himself by, he could
analyse, he could combine, he could compare and reason upon them,
with the utmost exactness; but he could not reason <em>out of</em> them. He
was what is understood by a <em>matter-of-fact</em> reasoner. He was better
acquainted with the concrete masses of things, their substantial forms,
and practical connexions, than with their abstract nature or general
definitions. He was a man of extensive information, of sound knowledge,
and clear understanding, rather than the acute observer or
profound thinker. He was the man of business, the accomplished
statesman, rather than the philosopher. His reasonings were,
generally speaking, calculations of certain positive results, which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>the <em>data</em> being given, must follow as matters of course, rather than
unexpected and remote truths drawn from a deep insight into human
nature, and the subtle application of general principles to particular
cases. They consisted chiefly in the detail and combination of a
vast number of items in an account, worked by the known rules
of political arithmetic; not in the discovery of bold, comprehensive,
and original theorems in the science. They were rather acts of
memory, of continued attention, of a power of bringing all his ideas
to bear at once upon a single point, than of reason or invention.
He was the attentive observer who watches the various effects and
successive movements of a machine already constructed, and can
tell how to manage it while it goes on as it has always done;
but who knows little or nothing of the principles on which it is
constructed, nor how to set it right, if it becomes disordered,
except by the most common and obvious expedients. Burke was
to Fox what the geometrician is to the mechanic. Much has been
said of the ‘prophetic mind’ of Mr. Fox. The same epithet has
been applied to Mr. Burke, till it has become proverbial. It
has, I think, been applied without much reason to either. Fox
wanted the scientific part, Burke wanted the practical. Fox had
too little imagination, Burke had too much: that is, he was careless
of facts, and was led away by his passions to look at one side
of a question only. He had not that fine sensibility to outward
impressions, that nice <em>tact</em> of circumstances, which is necessary
to the consummate politician. Indeed, his wisdom was more
that of the legislator than of the active statesman. They both
tried their strength in the Ulysses’ bow of politicians, the French
Revolution: and they were both foiled. Fox indeed foretold the
success of the French in combating with foreign powers. But
this was no more than what every friend of the liberty of France
foresaw or foretold as well as he. All those on the same side of
the question were inspired with the same sagacity on the subject.
Burke, on the other hand, seems to have been before-hand with
the public in foreboding the internal disorders that would attend
the Revolution, and its ultimate failure; but then it is at least a
question whether he did not make good his own predictions: and
certainly he saw into the causes and connexion of events much
more clearly after they had happened than before. He was however
undoubtedly a profound commentator on that apocalyptical
chapter in the history of human nature, which I do not think Fox
was. Whether led to it by the events or not, he saw thoroughly
into the principles that operated to produce them; and he pointed
them out to others in a manner which could not be mistaken. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>can conceive of Burke, as the genius of the storm, perched over
Paris, the centre and focus of anarchy, (so he would have us
believe) hovering ‘with mighty wings outspread over the abyss, and
rendering it pregnant,’ watching the passions of men gradually
unfolding themselves in new situations, penetrating those hidden
motives which hurried them from one extreme into another,
arranging and analysing the principles that alternately pervaded the
vast chaotic mass, and extracting the elements of order and the
cement of social life from the decomposition of all society: while
Charles Fox in the meantime dogged the heels of the Allies, (all
the way calling out to them to stop) with his sutler’s bag, his
muster-roll, and army estimates at his back. He said, You have
only fifty thousand troops, the enemy have a hundred thousand:
this place is dismantled, it can make no resistance: your troops
were beaten last year, they must therefore be disheartened this.
This is excellent sense and sound reasoning, but I do not see
what it has to do with philosophy. But why was it necessary
that Fox should be a philosopher? Why, in the first place,
Burke was a philosopher, and Fox, to keep up with him, must
be so too. In the second place, it was necessary, in order that
his indiscreet admirers, who had no idea of greatness but as it
consists in certain names and pompous titles, might be able to talk
big about their patron. It is a bad compliment we pay to our idol
when we endeavour to make him out something different from himself;
it shews that we are not satisfied with what he was. I have
heard it said that he had as much imagination as Burke. To this
extravagant assertion I shall make what I conceive to be a very
cautious and moderate answer: that Burke was as superior to Fox
in this respect as Fox perhaps was to the first person you would
meet in the street. There is in fact hardly an instance of imagination
to be met with in any of his speeches; what there is, is of the
rhetorical kind. I may, however, be wrong. He might excel as
much in profound thought, and richness of fancy, as he did in other
things; though I cannot perceive it. However, when any one
publishes a book called the Beauties of Fox, containing the original
reflections, brilliant passages, lofty metaphors, &amp;c. to be found in his
speeches, without the detail or connexion, I shall be very ready to
give the point up.</p>

<p class='c010'>In logic Fox was inferior to Pitt—indeed, in all the formalities
of eloquence, in which the latter excelled as much as he was
deficient in the soul or substance. When I say that Pitt was
superior to Fox in logic, I mean that he excelled him in the formal
division of the subject, in always keeping it in view, as far as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>chose; in being able to detect any deviation from it in others;
in the management of his general topics; in being aware of the
mood and figure in which the argument must move, with all its
nonessentials, dilemmas, and alternatives; in never committing
himself, nor ever suffering his antagonist to occupy an inch of the
plainest ground, but under cover of a syllogism. He had more
of ‘the dazzling fence of argument,’ as it has been called. He
was, in short, better at his weapon. But then, unfortunately, it
was only a dagger of lath that the wind could turn aside;
whereas Fox wore a good trusty blade, of solid metal, and real
execution.</p>

<p class='c010'>I shall not trouble myself to inquire whether Fox was a man
of strict virtue and principle; or in other words, how far he was
one of those who screw themselves up to a certain pitch of ideal
perfection, who, as it were, set themselves in the stocks of
morality, and make mouths at their own situation. He was not one
of that tribe, and shall not be tried by their self-denying ordinances.
But he was endowed with one of the most excellent
natures that ever fell to the lot of any of God’s creatures. It has
been said, that ‘an honest man’s the noblest work of God.’
There is indeed a purity, a rectitude, an integrity of heart, a
freedom from every selfish bias, and sinister motive, a manly
simplicity and noble disinterestedness of feeling, which is in my
opinion to be preferred before every other gift of nature or art.
There is a greatness of soul that is superior to all the brilliancy of
the understanding. This strength of moral character, which is
not only a more valuable but a rarer quality than strength of
understanding (as we are oftener led astray by the narrowness of our
feelings, than want of knowledge) Fox possessed in the highest
degree. He was superior to every kind of jealousy, of suspicion,
of malevolence; to every narrow and sordid motive. He was
perfectly above every species of duplicity, of low art and cunning.
He judged of every thing in the downright sincerity of his
nature, without being able to impose upon himself by any hollow
disguise, or to lend his support to any thing unfair or dishonourable.
He had an innate love of truth, of justice, of probity, of
whatever was generous or liberal. Neither his education, nor his
connexions, nor his situation in life, nor the low intrigues and
virulence of party, could ever alter the simplicity of his taste, nor
the candid openness of his nature. There was an elastic force
about his heart, a freshness of social feeling, a warm glowing
humanity, which remained unimpaired to the last. He was by
nature a gentleman. By this I mean that he felt a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>deference and respect for the person of every man; he had an unaffected
frankness and benignity in his behaviour to others, the utmost
liberality in judging of their conduct and motives. A refined
humanity constitutes the character of a gentleman.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c011'><sup>[61]</sup></a> He was the
true friend of his country, as far as it is possible for a statesman to
be so. But his love of his country did not consist in his hatred of
the rest of mankind. I shall conclude this account by repeating
what Burke said of him at a time when his testimony was of the
most value. ‘To his great and masterly understanding he joined the
utmost possible degree of moderation: he was of the most artless,
candid, open, and benevolent disposition; disinterested in the
extreme; of a temper mild and placable, even to a fault; and without
one drop of gall in his constitution.’</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHARACTER OF MR. PITT, 1806</h3>

<p class='c008'>The character of Mr. Pitt was, perhaps, one of the most
singular that ever existed. With few talents, and fewer virtues,
he acquired and preserved in one of the most trying situations,
and in spite of all opposition, the highest reputation for the possession
of every moral excellence, and as having carried the
attainments of eloquence and wisdom as far as human abilities
could go. This he did (strange as it appears) by a negation
(together with the common virtues) of the common vices of
human nature, and by the complete negation of every other talent
that might interfere with the only one which he possessed in a
supreme degree, and which indeed may be made to include the
appearance of all others—an artful use of words, and a certain
dexterity of logical arrangement. In these alone his power consisted;
and the defect of all other qualities, which usually constitute
greatness, contributed to the more complete success of these.
Having no strong feelings, no distinct perceptions, his mind
having no link, as it were, to connect it with the world of external
nature, every subject presented to him nothing more than a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula
rasa</span></i>, on which he was at liberty to lay whatever colouring of language
he pleased; having no general principles, no comprehensive views of
things, no moral habits of thinking, no system of action, there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>nothing to hinder him from pursuing any particular purpose, by any
means that offered; having never any plan, he could not be convicted
of inconsistency, and his own pride and obstinacy were the only rules
of his conduct. Having no insight into human nature, no sympathy
with the passions of men, or apprehension of their real designs, he
seemed perfectly insensible to the consequences of things, and would
believe nothing till it actually happened. The fog and haze in which
he saw every thing communicated itself to others; and the total indistinctness
and uncertainty of his own ideas tended to confound the
perceptions of his hearers more effectually than the most ingenious
misrepresentation could have done. Indeed, in defending his conduct
he never seemed to consider himself as at all responsible for the
success of his measures, or to suppose that future events were in our
own power; but that as the best-laid schemes might fail, and there
was no providing against all possible contingencies, this was a sufficient
excuse for our plunging at once into any dangerous or absurd enterprize,
without the least regard to consequences. His reserved logic
confined itself solely to the <em>possible</em> and the <em>impossible</em>; and he
appeared to regard the <em>probable</em> and <em>improbable</em>, the only foundation
of moral prudence or political wisdom, as beneath the notice of a
profound statesman; as if the pride of the human intellect were concerned
in never entrusting itself with subjects, where it may be
compelled to acknowledge its weakness.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c011'><sup>[62]</sup></a> From his manner of
reasoning, he seemed not to have believed that the truth of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>statements depended on the reality of the facts, but that the things
depended on the order in which he arranged them in words: you
would not suppose him to be agitating a serious question which had
real grounds to go upon, but to be declaiming upon an imaginary
thesis, proposed as an exercise in the schools. He never set himself
to examine the force of the objections that were brought against his
measures, or attempted to establish them upon clear, solid grounds of
his own; but constantly contented himself with first gravely stating
the logical form, or dilemma, to which the question reduced itself, and
then, after having declared his opinion, proceeded to amuse his hearers
by a series of rhetorical common places, connected together in grave,
sonorous, and elaborately constructed periods, without ever shewing
their real application to the subject in dispute. Thus, if any member
of the Opposition disapproved of any measure, and enforced his
objections by pointing out the many evils with which it was fraught,
or the difficulties attending its execution, his only answer was ‘that
it was true there might be inconveniences attending the measure
proposed, but we were to remember, that every expedient that could
be devised might be said to be nothing more than a choice of
difficulties, and that all that human prudence could do was to consider
on which side the advantages lay; that for his part, he conceived
that the present measure was attended with more advantages and
fewer disadvantages than any other that could be adopted; that if
we were diverted from our object by every appearance of difficulty,
the wheels of government would be clogged by endless delays and
imaginary grievances; that most of the objections made to the
measure appeared to him to be trivial, others of them unfounded and
improbable; or that if a scheme free from all these objections could
be proposed, it might after all prove inefficient; while, in the mean
time, a material object remained unprovided for, or the opportunity
of action was lost.’ This mode of reasoning is admirably described
by Hobbes, in speaking of the writings of some of the Schoolmen,
of whom he says, that ‘they had learned the trick of imposing what
they list upon their readers, and declining the force of true reason by
verbal forks; that is, distinctions which signify nothing, but serve
only to astonish the multitude of ignorant men.’ That what I have
here stated comprehends the whole force of his mind, which consisted
solely in this evasive dexterity and perplexing formality,
assisted by a copiousness of words and common-place topics, will, I
think, be evident to any one who carefully looks over his speeches,
undazzled by the reputation or personal influence of the speaker. It
will be in vain to look in them for any of the common proofs of
human genius or wisdom. He has not left behind him a single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>memorable saying—not one profound maxim—one solid observation—one
forcible description—one beautiful thought—one humourous
picture—one affecting sentiment.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c011'><sup>[63]</sup></a> He has made no addition whatever
to the stock of human knowledge. He did not possess any one
of those faculties which contribute to the instruction and delight of
mankind—depth of understanding, imagination, sensibility, wit,
vivacity, clear and solid judgment. But it may be asked, If these
qualities are not to be found in him, where are we to look for them?
And I may be required to point out instances of them. I shall
answer then, that he had none of the profound legislative wisdom,
piercing sagacity, or rich, impetuous, high-wrought imagination of
Burke; the manly eloquence, strong sense, exact knowledge,
vehemence and natural simplicity of Fox; the ease, brilliancy, and
acuteness of Sheridan. It is not merely that he had not all these
qualities in the degree that they were severally possessed by his
rivals, but he had not any of them in any striking degree. His
reasoning is a technical arrangement of unmeaning common-places;
his eloquence merely rhetorical; his style monotonous and artificial.
If he could pretend to any one excellence in an eminent degree, it
was to taste in composition. There is certainly nothing low, nothing
puerile, nothing far-fetched or abrupt in his speeches; there is a kind
of faultless regularity pervading them throughout; but in the confined,
mechanical, passive mode of eloquence which he adopted, it seemed
rather more difficult to commit errors than to avoid them. A man
who is determined never to move out of the beaten road, cannot lose
his way. However, habit, joined to the peculiar mechanical memory
which he possessed, carried this correctness to a degree which, in an
extemporaneous speaker, was almost miraculous; he perhaps hardly
ever uttered a sentence that was not perfectly regular and connected.
In this respect, he not only had the advantage over his own contemporaries,
but perhaps no one that ever lived equalled him in this
singular faculty. But for this, he would always have passed for a
common man; and to this the constant sameness, and, if I may so
say, vulgarity of his ideas, must have contributed not a little, as there
was nothing to distract his mind from this one object of his unintermitted
attention; and as even in his choice of words he never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>aimed at any thing more than a certain general propriety, and stately
uniformity of style. His talents were exactly fitted for the situation
in which he was placed; where it was his business, not to overcome
others, but to avoid being overcome. He was able to baffle opposition,
not from strength or firmness, but from the evasive ambiguity and
impalpable nature of his resistance, which gave no hold to the rude
grasp of his opponents: no force could bind the loose phantom, and
his mind (though ‘not matchless, and his pride humbled by such
rebuke,’) soon rose from defeat unhurt,</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Plutarch, in his comparative biography of Rome and Greece,
has generally chosen for each pair of Lives the two contemporaries
who most nearly resemble each other. His work would, perhaps,
have been more interesting, if he had adopted the contrary arrangement,
and selected those rather, who had attained to the possession
of similar influence, or similar fame, by means, actions, and talents
the most dissimilar. For power is the sole object of philosophical
attention in man, as in inanimate nature; and in the one equally as
in the other, we understand it more intimately, the more diverse the
circumstances are with which we have observed it to exist. In our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>days, the two persons who appear to have influenced the interests and
actions of men the most deeply and the most diffusively, are, beyond
doubt, the Chief Consul of France, and the Prime Minister of Great
Britain: and in these two, are presented to us similar situations, with
the greatest dissimilitude of characters.</p>

<p class='c010'>William Pitt was the younger son of Lord Chatham; a fact of no
ordinary importance in the solution of his character, of no mean
significance in the heraldry of morals and intellect. His father’s
rank, fame, political connexions, and parental ambition, were his
mould: he was cast, rather than grew. A palpable election, a
conscious predestination controlled the free agency, and transfigured
the individuality of his mind, and that, which he might have been,
was compelled into that, which he was to be. From his early childhood
it was his father’s custom to make him stand upon a chair, and
declaim before a large company; by which exercise, practised so
frequently, and continued for so many years, he acquired a premature
and unnatural dexterity in the combination of words, which must of
necessity have diverted his attention from present objects, obscured
his impressions, and deadened his genuine feelings. Not the thing on
which he was speaking, but the praises to be gained by the speech,
were present to his intuition; hence he associated all the operations
of his faculties with words, and his pleasures with the surprise excited
by them. But an inconceivably large portion of human knowledge
and human power is involved in the science and management of
words; and an education of words, though it destroys genius, will
often create and always foster, talent. The young Pitt was conspicuous
far beyond his fellows, both at school and at college. He
was always full-grown: he had neither the promise nor the awkwardness
of a growing intellect. Vanity, early satiated, formed, and
elevated itself into a love of power; and in losing this colloquial
vanity, he lost one of the prime links that connect the individual with
the species, too early for the affections, though not too early for the
understanding. At College he was a severe student; his mind was
founded and elemented in words and generalities, and these too
formed all the superstructure. That revelry and that debauchery,
which are so often fatal to the powers of intellect, would probably
have been serviceable to him; they would have given him a closer
communion with realities, they would have induced a greater presentness
to present objects. But Mr. Pitt’s conduct was correct, unimpressibly
correct. His after-discipline in the special pleader’s office,
and at the Bar, carried on the scheme of his education with unbroken
uniformity. His first political connexions were with the
Reformers; but those who accuse him of sympathising or coalescing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>with their intemperate or visionary plans, misunderstand his character,
and are ignorant of the historical facts. Imaginary situations in an
imaginary state of things, rise up in minds that possess a power and
facility in combining images. Mr. Pitt’s ambition was conversant
with old situations in the old state of things, which furnish nothing
to the imagination, though much to the wishes. In his endeavours
to realise his father’s plan of reform, he was probably as sincere as a
being, who had derived so little knowledge from actual impressions,
could be. But his sincerity had no living root of affection: while it
was propped up by his love of praise and immediate power, so long
it stood erect, and no longer. He became a member of the
Parliament, supported the popular opinions, and in a few years, by
the influence of the popular party, was placed in that high and awful
rank in which he now is. The fortunes of his country, we had
almost said the fates of the world, were placed in his wardship—we
sink in prostration before the inscrutable dispensations of Providence,
when we reflect in whose wardship the fates of the world were
placed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The influencer of his country and of his species was a young man,
the creature of another’s predetermination, sheltered and weather-fended
from all the elements of experience; a young man, whose
feet had never wandered, whose very eye had never turned to the
right or to the left, whose whole track had been as curveless as the
motions of a fascinated reptile! It was a young man, whose heart
was solitary, because he had existed always amid objects of futurity,
and whose imagination too was unpopulous, because those objects of
hope, to which his habitual wishes had transferred, and as it were,
projected his existence, were all familiar and long established objects.
A plant sown and reared in a hot-house, for whom the very air that
surrounded him, had been regulated by the thermometer of previous
purpose; to whom the light of nature had penetrated only through
glasses and covers, who had had the sun without the breeze; whom
no storm had shaken; on whom no rain had pattered; on whom the
dews of Heaven had not fallen! A being, who had had no feelings
connected with man or nature; no spontaneous impulses; no unbiassed
and desultory studies; no genuine science; nothing that
constitutes individuality in intellect; nothing that teaches brotherhood
in affection. Such was the man, such, and so denaturalized
the spirit, on whose wisdom and philanthropy the lives and living
enjoyments of so many millions of human beings were made unavoidably
dependent. From this time a real enlargement of mind
became almost impossible. Pre-occupations, intrigue, the undue
passion and anxiety, with which all facts must be surveyed; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>crowd and confusion of these facts, none of them seen, but all
communicated, and by that very circumstance, and by the necessity
of perpetually classifying them, transmuted into words and
generalities; pride, flattery, irritation, artificial power; these, and
circumstances resembling these, necessarily render the heights of
office barren heights, which command indeed a vast and extensive
prospect, but attract so many clouds and vapours, that, most often, all
prospect is precluded. Still, however, Mr. Pitt’s situation, however
inauspicious for his real being, was favourable to his fame. He
heaped period on period; persuaded himself and the nation, that
extemporaneous arrangement of sentences was eloquence; and that
eloquence implied wisdom. His father’s struggles for freedom, and
his own attempts, gave him an almost unexampled popularity; and
his office necessarily associated with his name all the great events,
that happened during his administration. There were not, however,
wanting men, who saw through the delusion: and refusing to
attribute the industry, integrity, and enterprising spirit of our
merchants, the agricultural improvements of our landholders, the great
inventions of our manufacturers, or the valor and skilfulness of our
sailors, to the merits of a Minister: they have continued to decide
on his character from those acts and those merits which belong to
him, and to him alone. Judging him by this standard, they have
been able to discover in him no one proof or symptom of a commanding
genius. They have discovered him never controlling, never
creating, events, but always yielding to them with rapid change,
and sheltering himself from inconsistency by perpetual indefiniteness.
In the Russian War, they saw him abandoning meanly
what he had planned weakly, and threatened insolently. In the
debates on the Regency, they detected the laxity of his constitutional
principles, and received proofs that his eloquence consisted
not in the ready application of a general system to particular
questions, but in the facility of arguing for or against any question
by specious generalities, without reference to any system. In
these debates, he combined what is most dangerous in democracy,
with all that is most degrading in the old superstitions of Monarchy,
and taught an inherency of the office in the person of the King,
which made the office itself a nullity, and the Premiership, with
its accompanying majority, the sole and permanent power of
the State. And now came the French Revolution. This was
a new event; the old routine of reasoning, the common trade of
politics, were to become obsolete. He appeared wholly unprepared
for it. Half favouring, half condemning, ignorant of what
he favoured, and why he condemned; he neither displayed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>honest enthusiasm and fixed principle of Mr. Fox, nor the intimate
acquaintance with the general nature of man, and the consequent
prescience of Mr. Burke. After the declaration of war,
long did he continue in the common cant of office, in declamation
about the Scheld, and Holland, and all the vulgar causes of
common contests, and when at last the immense genius of his new
supporter had beat him out of these words (words signifying
places and dead objects, and signifying nothing more) he adopted
other words in their places, other generalities—Atheism and
Jacobinism, phrases, which he had learnt from Mr. Burke, but
without learning the philosophical definitions and involved consequences,
with which that great man accompanied those words.
Since the death of Mr. Burke, the forms and the sentiments,
and the tone of the French, have undergone many and important
changes: how indeed is it possible, that it should be otherwise,
while man is the creature of experience? But still Mr. Pitt
proceeds in an endless repetition of the same general phrases.
This is his element: deprive him of general and abstract phrases,
and you reduce him to silence. But you cannot deprive him of
them. Press him to specify an individual fact of advantage to be
derived from a war, and he answers, Security. Call upon him to
particularise a crime, and he exclaims, Jacobinism. Abstractions
defined by abstractions—generalities defined by generalities! As
a minister of finance, he is still, as ever, the man of words and
abstractions, figures, Custom-house reports, imports and exports,
commerce and revenue—all flourishing, all splendid. Never was
such a prosperous country as England under his administration.
Let it be objected, that the agriculture of the country is, by the
overbalance of commerce, and by various and complex causes, in
such a state, that the country hangs as a pensioner for bread on
its neighbours, and a bad season uniformly threatens us with
famine, this (it is replied) is owing to our prosperity—all prosperous
nations are in great distress for food. Still prosperity,
still general phrases, uninforced by one single image, one single
fact of real national amelioration, of any one comfort enjoyed, where
it was not before enjoyed, of any one class of society becoming
healthier, or wiser, or happier. These are things, these are realities;
and these Mr. Pitt has neither the imagination to body forth, or
the sensibility to feel for. Once, indeed, in an evil hour intriguing
for popularity he suffered himself to be persuaded to evince a talent
for the real, the individual; and he brought in his Poor Bill.
When we hear the Minister’s talents for finance so loudly trumpeted,
we turn involuntarily to his Poor Bill, to that acknowledged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>abortion, that unanswerable evidence of his ignorance respecting all
the fundamental relations and actions of property, and of the social
union.</p>

<p class='c010'>As his reasonings, even so is his eloquence. One character pervades
his whole being. Words on words finely arranged, and so
dexterously consequent, that the whole bears the semblance of
argument, and still keeps awake a sense of surprise; but when
all is done, nothing rememberable has been said; no one philosophical
remark, no one image, not even a pointed aphorism.
Not a sentence of Mr. Pitt’s has ever been quoted, or formed
the favourite phrase of the day, a thing unexampled in any man
of equal reputation. But while he speaks, the effect varies according
to the character of his auditor. The man of no talent is
swallowed up in surprise: and when the speech is ended, he remembers
his feelings, but nothing distinct of that which produced
them; (how opposite an effect to that of nature and genius, from
whose works the idea still remains, when the feeling is passed
away, remains to connect itself with other feelings, and combine
with new impressions!). The mere man of talent hears him with
admiration, the mere man of genius with contempt; the philosopher
neither admires nor contemns, but listens to him with a
deep and solemn interest, tracing in the effects of his eloquence
the power of words and phrases, and that peculiar constitution of
human affairs in their present state, which so eminently favours this
power.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such appears to us to be the Prime Minister of Great Britain,
whether we consider him a statesman or an orator. The same
character betrays itself in his private life, the same coldness to
realities, to images of realities, and to all whose excellence relates
to reality.</p>

<p class='c010'>He has patronised no science, he has raised no man of genius
from obscurity; he counts no one prime work of God among his
friends. From the same source he has no attachment to female
society, no fondness for children, no perceptions of beauty in
natural scenery; but he is fond of convivial indulgences, of that
stimulation, which, keeping up the glow of self-importance and the
sense of internal power, gives feelings without the mediation of ideas.</p>

<p class='c010'>These are the elements of his mind; the accidents of his fortune,
the circumstances that enabled such a mind to acquire and
retain such a power, would form the subject of a philosophical
history, and that too of no scanty size. We scarcely furnish the
chapter of contents to a work which would comprise subjects so
important and delicate, as the causes of the diffusion and intensity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>of secret influence, the machinery and state intrigue of marriages,
the overbalance of the commercial interest; the panic of property
struck by the late Revolution, the short-sightedness of the careful,
the carelessness of the far-sighted; and all those many and various
events which have given to a decorous profession of religion, and
a seemliness of private morals, such an unwonted weight in the
attainment and preservation of public power. We are unable to
determine whether it be more consolatory or humiliating to human
nature, that so many complexities of event, situation, character, age,
and country, should be necessary in order to the production of a
Mr. Pitt.’</p>

<h3 class='c003'>AN EXAMINATION OF MR. MALTHUS’S DOCTRINES</h3>

<h4 class='c017'>I. OF THE GEOMETRICAL AND ARITHMETICAL SERIES</h4>

<p class='c018'>Wallace, the author of ‘<cite>Various Prospects of Mankind, Nature, and
Providence</cite>,’ was the first person, we believe, who applied the
principle of the superior power of increase in population over the
means of subsistence, as an insuperable objection to the arguments for
the perfectibility of man, for which, in other respects, this author was
an advocate. He has devoted a long and elaborate Essay to prove
these two points:—1. That there is a natural and necessary inability
in the means of subsistence to go on increasing always in the same
ratio as the population, the limits of the earth necessarily limiting the
actual increase of the one, and there being no limits to the tendency
to increase in the other; 2. That the checks which have hitherto,
and which always <em>must</em> keep population down to the level of the
means of subsistence, are <em>vice</em> and <em>misery</em>; and consequently, that in a
state of perfectibility, as it is called, viz. in a state of perfect wisdom,
virtue, and happiness, where these indispensable checks to population,
vice and misery, were entirely removed, population would go on
increasing to an alarming and most excessive degree, and unavoidably
end in the utmost disorder, confusion, vice and misery.—(See <cite>Various
Prospects, &amp;c.</cite> p. 113–123.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The principle laid down by this author, that population could not go
on for ever increasing at its natural rate, or free from every restraint,
either moral or physical, without ultimately outstripping the utmost
possible increase of the means of subsistence, we hold to be unquestionable,
if not self-evident: the other principle assumed by the original
author, viz. that vice and misery are the only possible checks to population,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>we hold to be false as a matter of fact, and peculiarly absurd
and contradictory, when applied to that state of society contemplated
by the author, that is to say, one in which abstract reason and pure
virtue, or a regard to the general good, should have got the better
of every animal instinct and selfish passion. Of this, perhaps, a word
hereafter. But be this as it may, both the principle of the necessary
increase of the population beyond the means of subsistence, and the
application of that principle as a final obstacle to all Utopian
perfectibility schemes, are borrowed (whole) by Mr. Malthus from
Wallace’s work. This is not very stoutly denied by his admirers;
but, say they, Mr. Malthus was the first to reduce the inequality
between the possible increase of food and population to a mathematical
certainty, to the arithmetical and geometrical ratios. In
answer to which, we say, that those ratios are, in a strict and scientific
view of the subject, entirely fallacious—a pure fiction. For a grain
of corn or of mustard-seed has the same or a greater power of
propagating its species than a man, till it has overspread the whole
earth, till there is no longer any room for it to grow or to spread
farther. A bushel of wheat will sow a whole field: the produce of
that field will sow twenty fields, and produce twenty harvests. Till
there are no longer fields to sow, that is, till a country or the earth is
exhausted, the means of subsistence will go on increasing in more
than a geometrical ratio; will more than double itself in every
generation or season, and will more than keep pace with the progress
of population; for this is supposed only to double itself, where it
is unchecked, every twenty years. Therefore it is not true as an
abstract proposition, that of itself, or in the nature of the growth of
the produce of the earth, food can only increase in the snail-pace
progress of an arithmetical ratio, while population goes on at a
swinging geometrical rate: for the food keeps pace, or more than
keeps pace, with the population, while there is room to grow it in,
and after that room is filled up, it does not go on, even in that
arithmetical ratio—it does not increase at all, or very little. That is,
the ratio, instead of being always true, is never true at all: neither
before the soil is fully cultivated, nor afterwards. Food does not
increase in an arithmetical series in China, or even in England: it
increases in a geometrical series, or as fast as the population, in
America. The rates at which one or the other increase naturally,
or can be made to increase, have no relation to an arithmetical and
geometrical series. They are co-ordinate till the earth, or any given
portion of it, is occupied and cultivated, and, after that, they are
quite disproportionate: or rather, both stop practically at the same
instant; the means of subsistence with the limits of the soil, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>population with the limits of the means of subsistence. All that is
true of Mr. Malthus’s doctrine, then, is this, that the tendency of
population to increase remains after the power of the earth to produce
more food is gone; that the one is limited, the other unlimited.
This is enough for the morality of the question: his mathematics are
altogether spurious. Entirely groundless as they are, they have still
been of the greatest use to Mr. Malthus, in alarming the imaginations
and confounding the understandings of his readers. For, if the case
had been represented as it stands, the increase of population would
have seemed, till the limits of the earth were full, a great moral good;
and after they were passed, a physical impossibility, the state of
society remaining the same. But, by means of the arithmetical and
geometrical series, ever present to the mental eye, and overlaying the
whole question, whether applicable to it or not, it seems, first, as if
this inordinate and unequal pressure of population on the means of
subsistence was, at all times, and in all circumstances, equally to be
dreaded, and equally inevitable; and again, as if, the more that
population advanced, the greater the evil became, the actual excess as
well as the tendency to excess. For it appears by looking at the
scale, at the ‘stop-watch’ of the new system of morals and legislation,
as if, when the population is at 4, the means of subsistence is at 3; so
that there is here only a deficit of 1 in the latter, and a small
corresponding quantity of <em>vice</em> and <em>misery</em>; but that when it gets on to
32, the means of subsistence being only 6, here is a necessary
deficiency of food, and all the comforts of life, to 26 persons out of
32, so that life becomes an evil, and the world a wretched lazar-house,
a monstrous sink of misery and famine, one foul abortion, in
proportion as it is full of human beings enjoying the comforts and
necessaries of life. It consequently follows, that the more we can,
by the wholesome <em>preventive</em> checks of vice and misery, keep back
the principle of population to its first stages, and the means of
subsistence to as low a level as possible, we keep these two mechanical,
and otherwise unmanageable principles, in closer harmony,—hinder
the one from pressing excessively on the other, and by producing the
least possible quantity of good, prevent the greatest possible quantity
of evil. This doctrine is false in fact and theory. Its advocates do
not understand it, nor is it intelligible. The actual existence of 26
persons in want, when there is only food for six out of 32, is a
chimera which never entered the brains of any one not an adept in
Mr. Malthus’s mathematical series; the population confessedly never
can or does exceed the means of subsistence in a literal sense; and
the tendency to exceed it in a moral sense, that is, so as to destroy
the comforts and happiness of society, and occasion vice and misery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>does not depend on the actual population supported by actual means
of subsistence, but solely on the greater or less degree of <em>moral
restraint</em>, in any number of individuals (ten hundred or ten millions),
inducing them to go beyond or stop short of impending vice and
misery in the career of population. The instant, however, any
increase in population, with or without an increase in the means of
subsistence, is hinted, the disciples of Mr. Malthus are struck with
horror at the vice and misery which must ensue to keep this double
population down; nay, mention any improvement, any reform, any
addition to the comforts or necessaries of life, any diminution of
vice and misery, and the infallible result in their apprehensive
imaginations is only an incalculable increase of vice and misery,
from the increased means of subsistence, and the increased population
that would follow. They have but this one idea in their heads;
it comes in at every turn, and nothing can drive it out. Twice
last year did Major Torrens go down to the City Meeting with
Mr. Malthus’s arithmetical and geometrical ratios in his pocket, as a
double and effectual bar to Mr. Owen’s plan, or, indeed, if he is
consistent, to any other plan of reform. He appeared to consider
these ratios as decisive against any philosophical scheme of <em>perfectibility</em>,
and as proportionably inimical to any subordinate approximation to
any such ultimate visionary perfection. He argued that Mr. Owen’s
‘projected villages,’ if realised in all their pauper splendour, and to
the projector’s heart’s content, would, by providing for the support
and increased comforts of an additional population, only (by that very
means) give a double impetus to the mechanical operation of the
ratios in question, and produce a double quantity of crime and
misery, by making the principle of population press with extended
force on the means of subsistence. This is what we cannot comprehend.
Suppose Mr. Owen’s plan, or any other, would afford
double employment, double comfort and subsistence to the poor
throughout the country, where would be the harm of this, where
the objection, near or remote, except on the false principles laid down
or insinuated in Mr. Malthus’s work? For instance, if another
island such as England could by an enchanter be conjured up in
the middle of the sea, with all the same means of subsistence, arts,
trades, agriculture, manufactures, institutions, laws, &amp;c. as this country,
we ask whether this new country would not be a good in proportion
to the number of beings maintained in such a state of comfort: or, if
these gentlemen will have it so, in proportion to the increase of
population pressing on the means of subsistence? We say it would
be a good, just in the same sense and proportion that it would be an
evil, if England as it is, with all its inhabitants, means of subsistence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>arts, trades, manufactures, agriculture, institutions, laws, King, Lords
and Commons, were sunk in the sea? Who would not weep for
England so sunk,—who would not rejoice to see another England so
rising up out of the same element? The good would be immense,
and the evil would be none: for it is evident, that though the
population of both islands would be double that of either singly,
it is the height of absurdity to suppose this would increase the
tendency of the population to press more upon the means of subsistence,
or to produce a greater quantity of vice and misery in either,
than if the one or the other did not exist. But the case is precisely
the same if we suppose England itself, <em>our</em> England, to be doubled in
population and the means of subsistence:—if we suppose such an
improvement in our arts, trade, manufactures, agriculture, institutions,
laws, every thing, possible, as to maintain double the same number of
Englishmen, in the same or in a greater degree of comfort and
enjoyment, of liberty, virtue, knowledge, happiness, and independence.
The population being doubled would not press more unequally on
double the means of subsistence, than half that population would press
on half those means of subsistence. If this increase would be an
evil, the destroying half the present population, and half the present
means of subsistence, the laying waste more lands, the destroying
arts and the implements of husbandry, the re-barbarising and the
re-enslaving the country, would be a good. The sinking the maritime
counties with all their inhabitants in the Channel, instead of ‘redeeming
tracts from the sea,’ would be a great good to the community
and the State; the flooding the fen districts would do something, in
like manner, to prevent the pressure of the principle of population on
the level of the means of subsistence; and if thirty-nine out of forty
of the counties could be struck off the list of shires, and the whole
island reduced to a sand-bank, the King of England would reign,
according to these speculatists, over forty or forty thousand times the
quantity of liberty, happiness, wisdom, and virtue, that he now does,
having no subjects, or only a select few, for the principle of population
to commit its ravages upon, by overstepping the means of subsistence.
The condition of New Zealand must approach nearer to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</span></i>
of political philosophy contemplated by these persons, than the state
of Great Britain in the reign of George <span class='fss'>III.</span> Such is the logical
result of their mode of reasoning, though they do not push it to this
length;—they only apply it to the defence of all existing abuses, and
the prevention of all timely reform! Its advocates are contented to
make use of it as a lucky diversion against all Utopian projects of
perfectibility, and against every practical advance in human improvement.
But they cannot consistently stop here, for it requires not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>only a shrinking back from every progressive refinement, but a
perpetual deterioration and retrograde movement from the positive
advances we have made in civilization, comfort, and population, to
the lowest state of barbarism, ignorance, and depopulation—till we
come back to the age of acorns and pig-nuts, and reduce this once
flourishing, populous, free, industrious, independent, and contented
people, to a horde of wandering savages, housing in thickets, and
living on dewberries, shell-fish, and crab-apples. <em>This will never do.</em></p>

<h3 class='c003'>ON THE ORIGINALITY OF MR. MALTHUS’S ESSAY</h3>

<p class='c008'>We asserted in a former article, upon what we thought sufficient and
mature grounds, that the author of the ‘Essay on Population’ had
taken the leading principle of that essay, and the general inference
built on it, from Wallace’s work, entitled, ‘Various Prospects of
Mankind, Nature and Providence.’ We here repeat that assertion;
and to enable our readers to judge for themselves, shall give the
passage in Wallace on which it is founded. It is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘But without entering further into these abstracted and uncertain
speculations, it deserves our particular attention that as no Government
which hath hitherto been established is free from all seeds of
corruption, or can be expected to be eternal; so if we suppose a
Government to be perfect in its original frame, and to be administered
in the most perfect manner, after whatever model we suppose it to
have been framed, such a perfect form would be so far from lasting
for ever, that it must come to an end so much the sooner on account
of its perfection. For, though happily such Governments should be
firmly established—though they should be found consistent with the
reigning passions of human nature, though they should spread far and
wide—nay, though they should prevail universally, they must at last
involve mankind in the deepest perplexity, and in universal confusion.
For how excellent soever they may be in their own nature, they are
altogether inconsistent with the present frame of nature, and with a
limited extent of earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Under a perfect Government, the inconveniences of having a
family would be so entirely removed, children would be so well
taken care of, and every thing become so favourable to populousness,
that though some sickly seasons or dreadful plagues in particular
climates might cut off multitudes, yet in general, mankind would
increase so prodigiously, that the earth would at last be overstocked,
and become unable to support its numerous inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>‘How long the earth, with the best culture of which it is capable
from human genius and industry, might be able to nourish its
perpetually increasing inhabitants, is as impossible as it is unnecessary
to be determined. It is not probable that it could have supported
them during so long a period as since the creation of Adam. But
whatever may be supposed of the length of this period, of necessity it
must be granted, that the earth could not nourish them for ever,
unless either its fertility could be continually augmented, or by some
secret in nature, like what certain enthusiasts have expected from the
philosopher’s stone, some wise adept in the occult sciences should
invent a method of supporting mankind quite different from any thing
known at present. Nay, though some extraordinary method of
supporting them might possibly be found out, yet if there was no
bound to the increase of mankind, which would be the case under a
perfect Government, there would not even be sufficient room for
containing their bodies upon the surface of the earth, or upon any
limited surface whatsoever. It would be necessary, therefore, in
order to find room for such multitudes of men, that the earth
should be continually enlarging in bulk, as an animal or vegetable
body.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Now since philosophers may as soon attempt to make mankind
immortal, as to support the animal frame without food, it is equally
certain that limits are set to the fertility of the earth; and that its
bulk, so far as is hitherto known, hath continued always the same,
and probably could not be much altered without making considerable
changes in the solar system. It would be impossible, therefore, to
support the great numbers of men who would be raised up under
a perfect government; the earth would be overstocked at last, and
the greatest admirers of such fanciful schemes must foresee the fatal
period when they would come to an end, as they are altogether
inconsistent with the limits of that earth in which they must exist.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What a miserable catastrophe of the most generous of all human
systems of Government! How dreadfully would the Magistrates of
such commonwealths find themselves disconcerted at that fatal period,
when there was no longer any room for new colonies, and when the
earth could produce no farther supplies! During all the preceding
ages, while there was room for increase, mankind must have been
happy; the earth must have been a paradise in the literal sense, as
the greatest part of it must have been turned into delightful and
fruitful gardens. But when the dreadful time should at last come,
when our globe, by the most diligent culture, could not produce what
was sufficient to nourish its numerous inhabitants, what happy expedient
could then be found out to remedy so great an evil?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>‘In such a cruel necessity, must there be a law to restrain marriage?
Must multitudes of women be shut up in cloisters, like the ancient
vestals or modern nuns? To keep a balance between the two sexes,
must a proportionable number of men be debarred from marriage?
Shall the Utopians, following the wicked policy of superstition,
forbid their priests to marry; or shall they rather sacrifice men of
some other profession for the good of the state? Or shall they
appoint the sons of certain families to be maimed at their birth, and
give a sanction to the unnatural institution of eunuchs? If none of
these expedients can be thought proper, shall they appoint a certain
number of infants to be exposed to death as soon as they are born,
determining the proportion according to the exigencies of the state;
and pointing out the particular victims by lot, or according to some
established rule? Or, must they shorten the period of human life by
a law, and condemn all to die after they had completed a certain age,
which might be shorter or longer, as provisions were either more
scanty or plentiful? Or, what other method should they devise (for
an expedient would be absolutely necessary) to restrain the number of
citizens within reasonable bounds?</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Alas! how unnatural and inhuman must every such expedient be
accounted! The natural passions and appetites of mankind are
planted in our frame, to answer the best ends for the happiness
both of the individuals and of the species. Shall we be obliged to
contradict such a wise order? Shall we be laid under the necessity
of acting barbarously and inhumanly? Sad and fatal necessity!
And which, after all, could never answer the end, but would give
rise to violence and war. For mankind would never agree about
such regulations. Force, and arms, must at last decide their quarrels,
and the deaths of such as fell in battle, leave sufficient provisions for
the survivors, and make room for others to be born.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Thus the tranquillity and numerous blessings of the Utopian
governments would come to an end; war, or cruel and unnatural
customs, be introduced, and a stop put to the increase of mankind, to
the advancement of knowledge, and to the culture of the earth, in
spite of the most excellent laws and wisest precautions. The more
excellent the laws had been, and the more strictly they had been
observed, mankind must have sooner become miserable. The
remembrance of former times, the greatness of their wisdom and
virtue, would conspire to heighten their distress; and the world,
instead of remaining the mansion of wisdom and happiness, become
the scene of vice and confusion. Force and fraud must prevail, and
mankind be reduced to the same calamitous condition as at present.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Such a melancholy situation, in consequence merely of the want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>of provisions, is, in truth, more unnatural than all their present
calamities. Supposing men to have abused their liberty, by which
abuse vice has once been introduced into the world; and that wrong
notions, a bad taste, and vicious habits have been strengthened by the
defects of education and government, our present distresses may be
easily explained. They may even be called natural, being the natural
consequences of our depravity. They may be supposed to be the
means by which Providence punishes vice; and by setting bounds to
the increase of mankind, prevents the earth’s being overstocked, and
men being laid under the cruel necessity of killing one another. But
to suppose that, in the course of a favourable Providence, a perfect
government had been established, under which the disorders of human
passions had been powerfully corrected and restrained; poverty,
idleness, and war banished; the earth made a paradise; universal
friendship and concord established, and human society rendered
flourishing in all respects; and that such a lovely Constitution
should be overturned, not by the vices of men, or their abuse of
liberty, but by the order of nature itself, seems wholly unnatural,
and altogether disagreeable to the methods of Providence.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘By reasoning in this manner, it is not pretended that ’tis unnatural
to set bounds to human knowledge and happiness, or to the grandeur
of society, and to confine what is finite to proper limits. It is
certainly fit to set just bounds to every thing according to its nature,
and to adjust all things in due proportion to one another. Undoubtedly,
such an excellent order is actually established throughout
all the works of God, in his wide dominions. But there are certain
primary determinations in nature, to which all other things of a
subordinate kind must be adjusted. A limited earth, a limited
degree of fertility, and the continual increase of mankind, are three
of these original constitutions. To these determinations, human
affairs, and the circumstance of all other animals, must be adapted.
In which view, it is unsuitable to our ideas of order, that while the
earth is only capable of maintaining a determined number, the human
race should increase without end. This would be the necessary
consequence of a perfect government and education. On which
account it is more contrary to just proportion, to suppose that such a
perfect government should be established, in such circumstances, than
that by permitting vice, or the abuse of liberty, in the wisdom of
Providence, mankind should never be able to multiply so as to be
able to overstock the earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘From this view of the circumstances of the world, notwithstanding
the high opinion we have of the merits of Sir Thomas More, and
other admired projectors of perfect governments in ancient or modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>times, we may discern how little can be expected from their most
perfect systems.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘As for those worthy philosophers, patriots, and law-givers, who
have employed their talents in framing such excellent models, we
ought to do justice to their characters, and gratefully to acknowledge
their generous efforts to rescue the world out of that distress into
which it has fallen, through the imperfection of government. Sincere,
and ardent in their love of virtue, enamoured of its lovely form,
deeply interested for the happiness of mankind, to the best of their
skill, and with hearts full of zeal, they have strenuously endeavoured
to advance human society to perfection. For this, their memory
ought to be sacred to posterity. But if they expected their beautiful
systems actually to take place, their hopes were ill founded, and they
were not sufficiently aware of the consequences.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘The speculations of such ingenious authors enlarge our views, and
amuse our fancies. They are useful for directing us to correct
certain errors at particular times. Able legislators ought to consider
them as models, and honest patriots ought never to lose sight of
them, or any proper opportunity of transplanting the wisest of their
maxims into their own governments, as far as they are adapted to
their particular circumstances, and will give no occasion to dangerous
convulsions. But this is all that can be expected. Though such
ingenious romances should chance to be read and admired, jealous
and selfish politicians need not be alarmed. Such statesmen need
not fear that ever such airy systems shall be able to destroy their
craft, or disappoint them of their intention to sacrifice the interests of
mankind to their own avarice or ambition. There is too powerful a
charm, which works secretly in favour of such politicians, which will
for ever defeat all attempts to establish a perfect government. There
is no need of miracles for this purpose. The vices of mankind are
sufficient. And we need not doubt but Providence will make use
of them, for preventing the establishment of governments which are
by no means suitable to the present circumstances of the earth.’—See

<p class='c010'>Here then we have not only the same argument stated, but stated
in the same connexion, and brought to bear on the very same subject
to which it is applied by the author of the Essay on Population.
The principle, and the consequences deduced from it, are exactly the
same. It may happen (and often does) that one man is the first to
make a particular discovery or observation, and that another draws
from it an important inference of which the former was not at all
aware. But this is not the case in the present instance. As far as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>general reasoning will go, it is impossible that any thing should be
stated more clearly, more fully and explicitly, than Wallace has here
stated the argument against the progressive and ultimate amelioration
of human society, from the sole principle of population. We have
already seen that the addition which Mr. Malthus has made to the
argument, from the geometrical and arithmetical series, is a fallacy,
and not an improvement. The conclusion itself insisted on in the
above passage, by Wallace, appears to us no better than a contradiction
in terms. Of the possibility of realising such a Utopian
system as he first supposes, that is, of making every motive and
principle of action in the human mind absolutely and completely
subservient to the dictates of reason and the calculation of consequences,
we do not say a word; but we <em>do</em> say, that if such a
system is possible, and if it were realised, it would not be destroyed
by the principle of population, that is, by the unrestrained propagation
of the species from a blind, headlong, instinctive, irrational impulse,
and with a total and sovereign disregard of the fatal and overwhelming
consequences which would ensue. The argument is a solecism; but if
Wallace shewed his ingenuity in inventing it, Mr. Malthus has not
shown his judgment in adopting it. Through the whole of the
first edition of the Essay on Population, the author assumed the
impulse to propagate the species as a law, and a physical necessity of
the same force as that of preserving the individual, or, in other words,
he sets down, 1st, hunger, 2d, the sexual appetite, as two co-ordinate,
and equally irresistible principles of action. It was necessary that he
should do this, in order to bear out his conclusion against the Utopian
systems of his antagonists; for, in order to maintain that this
principle of population would be proof against the highest possible
degree of reason, we must suppose it to be an absolute physical
necessity. If reason has any practical power over it, the highest
reason must be able to attain an habitual power over it. Mr. Malthus,
however, having by the rigid interpretation which he gave to his
favourite principle, or by what he called the <em>iron law of necessity</em>,
succeeded in laying the bugbear of the modern philosophy, relaxed
considerably in the second and following editions of his book, in
which he introduced <em>moral restraint</em> as a third check upon the
principle of population, in addition to the two only ones of vice and
misery, with which he before combated the Utopian philosophers;
and though he does not lay an exaggerated or consistent stress on
this third check, yet he thinks something may be done to lighten the
intolerable pressure, the heavy hand of vice and misery, by flattering
old maids, and frightening the poor into the practice of moral
restraint! It will be recollected by those who are familiar with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>history of Mr. Malthus’s writings, that his first and grand effort was
directed against the modern philosophy. The use which this author
has since made of his principle, and of the arithmetical and geometrical
ratios to shut up the workhouse, to <em>snub</em> the poor, to stint them in
their wages, to deny them relief from the parish, and preach lectures
to them on the new invented crime of matrimony, was an afterthought;
of the merit of which we shall speak in another article.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>ON THE PRINCIPLE OF POPULATION AS AFFECTING THE SCHEMES OF UTOPIAN IMPROVEMENT</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>‘A swaggering paradox, when once explained, soon sinks into an unmeaning common-place.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This excellent saying of a great man was never more strictly
applicable to any system than it is to Mr. Malthus’s paradox, and
his explanation of it. It seemed, on the first publication of the
Essay on Population, as if the whole world was going to be turned
topsy-turvy, all our ideas of moral good and evil, were in a manner
confounded, we scarcely knew whether we stood on our head or our
heels: but after exciting considerable expectation, giving us a good
shake, and making us a little dizzy, Mr. Malthus does as we do
when we shew the children <em>London</em>,—sets us on our feet again, and
every thing goes on as before. The common notions that prevailed
on this subject, till our author’s first population-scheme tended to
weaken them, were that life is a blessing, and that the more people
could be maintained in any state in a tolerable degree of health,
comfort and decency, the better: that want and misery are not
desirable in themselves, that famine is not to be courted for its own
sake, that wars, disease and pestilence are not what every friend of
his country or his species should pray for in the first place: that vice
in its different shapes is a thing that the world could do very well
without, and that if it could be got rid of altogether, it would be a
great gain. In short, that the object both of the moralist and
politician was to diminish as much as possible the quantity of vice
and misery existing in the world: without apprehending that by thus
effectually introducing more virtue and happiness, more reason and
good sense, that by improving the manners of a people, removing
pernicious habits and principles of acting, or securing greater plenty,
and a greater number of mouths to partake of it, they were doing a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>disservice to humanity. Then comes Mr. Malthus with his octavo
book, and tells us there is another great evil, which had never been
found out, or at least not sufficiently attended to till his time, namely,
excessive population: that this evil was infinitely greater and more
to be dreaded than all others put together; and that its approach
could only be checked by vice and misery: that any increase of virtue
or happiness was the direct way to hasten it on; and that in proportion
as we attempted to improve the condition of mankind, and
lessened the restraints of vice and misery, we threw down the only
barriers that could protect us from this most formidable scourge of
the species, population. Vice and misery were indeed evils, but they
were absolutely necessary evils; necessary to prevent the introduction
of others of an incalculably and inconceivably greater magnitude; and
that every proposal to lessen their actual quantity, on which the
measure of our safety depended, might be attended with the most
ruinous consequences, and ought to be looked upon with horror. I
think that this description of the tendency and complexion of Mr.
Malthus’s first essay is not in the least exaggerated, but an exact and
faithful picture of the impression, which is made on every one’s mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>After taking some time to recover from the surprise and hurry
into which so great a discovery would naturally throw him, he
comes forward again with a large quarto, in which he is at great
pains both to say and unsay all that he has said in his former volume;
and upon the whole concludes, that population is in itself a good
thing, that it is never likely to do much harm, that virtue and
happiness ought to be promoted by every practicable means, and that
the most effectual as well as desirable check to excessive population
is <em>moral restraint</em>. The mighty discovery thus reduced to, and
pieced out by common sense, the wonder vanishes, and we breathe
a little freely again. Mr. Malthus is, however, by no means willing
to give up his old doctrine, or <em>eat his own words</em>: he stickles stoutly
for it at times. He has his fits of reason and his fits of extravagance,
his yielding and his obstinate moments, fluctuating between the two,
and vibrating backwards and forwards with a dexterity of self-contradiction
which it is wonderful to behold. The following
passage is so curious in this respect that I cannot help quoting it
in this place. Speaking of the Reply of the author of the Political
Justice to his former work, he observes, ‘But Mr. Godwin says,
that if he looks into the past history of the world, he does not see
that increasing population has been controlled and confined by vice
and misery <em>alone</em>. <em>In this observation I cannot agree with him.</em> I
will thank Mr. Godwin to name to me any check, that in past ages
has contributed to keep down the population to the level of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>means of subsistence, that does not fairly come under some form of
vice or misery; except indeed the check of <em>moral restraint, which I
have mentioned in the course of this work</em>; and which to say the truth,
whatever hopes we may entertain of its prevalence in future, has
undoubtedly in past ages operated with very inconsiderable force.’<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c011'><sup>[65]</sup></a>
When I assure the reader that I give him this passage fairly and
fully, I think he will be of opinion with me, that it would be difficult
to produce an instance of a more miserable attempt to reconcile a
contradiction by childish evasion, to insist upon an argument, and
give it up in the same breath. Does Mr. Malthus really think that
he has such an absolute right and authority over this subject of
population, that provided he mentions a principle, or shews that he
is not ignorant of it, and cannot be caught <em>napping</em> by the critics, he
is at liberty to say that it has or has not had any operation, just
as he pleases, and that the state of the fact is a matter of perfect
indifference? He contradicts the opinion of Mr. Godwin that vice
and misery are not the only checks to population, and gives as a proof
of his assertion, that he himself truly has mentioned another check.
Thus after flatly denying that moral restraint has any effect at all,
he modestly concludes by saying that it has had some, no doubt, but
promises that it will never have a great deal. Yet in the very next
page, he says, ‘On this sentiment, whether virtue, prudence or pride,
which I have already noticed under the name of moral restraint,
or of the more comprehensive title, the <em>preventive</em> check, it will
appear, that in the sequel of this work, I shall lay considerable
stress.’ p. 385. This kind of reasoning is enough to give one the
headache.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most singular thing in this singular performance of our author
is, that it should have been originally ushered into the world as the
most complete and only satisfactory answer to the speculations of
Godwin, Condorcet and others, or to what has been called the
modern philosophy. A more complete piece of wrong-headedness,
a more strange perversion of reason could hardly be devised by the
wit of man. Whatever we may think of the doctrine of the progressive
improvement of the human mind, or of a state of society in
which every thing will be subject to the absolute control of reason,
however absurd, unnatural, or impracticable we may conceive such
a system to be, certainly it cannot without the grossest inconsistency
be objected to it, that such a system would necessarily be rendered
abortive, because if reason should ever get the mastery over all our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>actions, we shall then be governed entirely by our physical appetites
and passions, without the least regard to consequences. This appears
to me a refinement on absurdity. Several philosophers and speculatists
had supposed that a certain state of society very different from any
that has hitherto existed was in itself practicable; and that if it were
realised, it would be productive of a far greater degree of human
happiness than is compatible with the present institutions of society.
I have nothing to do with either of these points. I will allow to
any one who pleases that all such schemes are ‘false, sophistical,
unfounded in the extreme.’ But I cannot agree with Mr. Malthus
that they would be <em>bad</em>, in proportion as they were <em>good</em>; that their
excellence would be their ruin; or that the true and only unanswerable
objection against all such schemes is that very degree of happiness,
virtue, and improvement, to which they are supposed to give
rise. And I cannot agree with him in this, because it is contrary
to common sense, and leads to the subversion of every principle of
moral reasoning. Without perplexing himself with the subtle
arguments of his opponents, Mr. Malthus comes boldly forward,
and says, ‘Gentlemen, I am willing to make you large concessions,
I am ready to allow the practicability and the desirableness of your
schemes; the more happiness, the more virtue, the more refinement
they are productive of, the better; all these will only add to the
“exuberant strength of my argument”; I have a short answer to
all objections, to be sure I found it in an old political receipt-book,
called Prospects, &amp;c. by one Wallace, a man not much known, but
no matter for that, <em>finding is keeping</em>, you know:’ and with one
smart stroke of his wand, on which are inscribed certain mystical
characters, and algebraic proportions, he levels the fairy enchantment
with the ground. For, says Mr. Malthus, though this improved
state of society were actually realised, it could not possibly continue,
but must soon terminate in a state of things pregnant with evils far
more insupportable than any we at present endure, in consequence of
the excessive population which would follow, and the impossibility
of providing for its support.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is what I do not understand. It is, in other words, to
assert that the doubling the population of a country, for example,
after a certain period, will be attended with the most pernicious
effects, by want, famine, bloodshed, and a state of general violence
and confusion; this will afterwards lead to vices and practices still
worse than the physical evils they are designed to prevent, &amp;c.
and yet that at this period those who will be the most interested
in preventing these consequences, and the best acquainted with the
circumstances that lead to them, will neither have the understanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>to foresee, nor the heart to feel, nor the will to prevent the sure
evils to which they expose themselves and others, though this
advanced state of population, which does not admit of any addition
without danger is supposed to be the immediate result of a more
general diffusion of the comforts and conveniences of life, of more
enlarged and liberal views, of a more refined and comprehensive
regard to our own permanent interests, as well as those of others,
of correspondent habits and manners, and of a state of things, in
which our gross animal appetites will be subjected to the practical
control of reason. The influence of rational motives, of refined
and long-sighted views of things is supposed to have taken the place
of narrow, selfish, and merely sensual motives: this is implied in
the very statement of the question. ‘What conjuration and what
mighty magic’ should thus blind our philosophical descendants
on this single subject in which they are more interested than
in all the rest, so that they should stand with their eyes open
on the edge of a precipice, and instead of retreating from it, should
throw themselves down headlong, I cannot comprehend; unless
indeed we suppose that the impulse to propagate the species is
so strong and uncontrolable, that reason has no power over it.
This is what Mr. Malthus was at one time strongly disposed to
assert, and what he is at present half inclined to retract. Without
this foundation to rest on, the whole of his reasoning is unintelligible.
It seems to me a most childish way of answering any one, who
chooses to assert that mankind are capable of being governed
entirely by their reason, and that it would be better for them if they
were, to say, No, for if they were governed entirely by it, they
would be much less able to attend to its dictates than they are at
present: and the evils, which would thus follow from the unrestrained
increase of population, would be excessive.—Almost every little
Miss, who has had the advantage of a boarding-school education, or
been properly tutored by her mamma, whose hair is not of an absolute
flame-colour, and who has hopes in time, if she behaves prettily, of
getting a good husband, waits patiently year after year, looks about
her, rejects or trifles with half a dozen lovers, favouring one, laughing
at another, chusing among them ‘as one picks pears, saying, this I
like, that I loathe,’ with the greatest indifference, as if it were no
such very pressing affair, and <em>all the while behaves very prettily</em>:—why,
what an idea does Mr. Malthus give us of the grave, masculine
genius of our Utopian philosophers, their sublime attainments and
gigantic energy, that they will not be able to manage these matters as
decently and cleverly as the silliest woman can do at present! Mr.
Malthus indeed endeavours to soften the absurdity by saying that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>moral restraint at present owes its strength to selfish motives: what
is that to the purpose? If Mr. Malthus chooses to say, that men
will always be governed by the same gross mechanical motives that
they are at present, I have no objection to make to it; but it is
shifting the question: it is not arguing against the state of society we
are considering from the consequences to which it would give rise,
but against the possibility of its ever existing. It is absurd to object
to a system on account of the consequences which would follow if we
once suppose men to be actuated by entirely different motives and
principles from what they are at present, and then to say, that those
consequences would necessarily follow, because men would never be
what we suppose them. It is very idle to alarm the imagination by
deprecating the evils that must follow from the practical adoption of
a particular scheme, yet to allow that we have no reason to dread
those consequences, but because the scheme itself is impracticable.—But
I am ashamed of wasting the reader’s time and my own in thus
beating the air. It is not however my fault that Mr. Malthus has
written nonsense, or that others have admired it. It is not Mr.
Malthus’s nonsense, but the opinion of the world respecting it, that
I would be thought to compliment by this serious refutation of what
in itself neither deserves nor admits of any reasoning upon it. If,
however, we recollect the source from whence Mr. Malthus borrowed
his principle and the application of it to improvements in political
philosophy, we must allow that he is merely passive in error. The
principle itself would not have been worth a farthing to him without
the application, and accordingly he took them as he found them lying
snug together; and as Trim having converted the old jack-boots into
a pair of new mortars immediately planted them against whichever of
my uncle Toby’s garrisons the allies were then busy in besieging, so
the public-spirited gallantry of our modern engineer directed him to
bend the whole force of his clumsy discovery against that system of
philosophy which was the most talked of at the time, but to which
it was the least applicable of all others. Wallace, I have no doubt,
took up his idea either as a paradox, or a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</span></i>, or because any
thing, he thought, was of weight enough to overturn what had
never existed any where but in the imagination; or he was led into
a piece of false logic by an error we are very apt to fall into, of
supposing because he had never been struck himself by the difficulty
of population in such a state of society, that therefore the people
themselves would not find it out, nor make any provision against it.
But though I can in some measure excuse a lively paradox, I do not
think the same favour is to be shewn to the dull, dogged, voluminous
repetition of an absurdity.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>I cannot help thinking that our author has been too much influenced
in his different feelings on this subject, by the particular purpose he
had in view at the time. Mr. Malthus might not improperly have
taken for the motto of his first edition,—‘These three bear record
on earth, vice, misery, and population.’ In his answer to Mr.
Godwin, this principle was represented as an evil, for which no
remedy could be found but in evil;—that its operation was mechanical,
unceasing, necessary; that it went straight forward to its end, unchecked
by fear, or reason, or remorse; that the evils, which it
drew after it, could only be avoided by other evils, by actual vice
and misery. Population was, in fact, the great Devil, the untamed
Beelzebub that was only kept chained down by vice and misery, and
which, if it were once let loose from these restraints, would go forth,
and ravage the earth. That they were, of course, the two main
props and pillars of society, and that the lower and weaker they kept
this principle, the better able they were to contend with it: that
therefore any diminution of that degree of them, which at present
prevails, and is found sufficient to keep the world in order, was of
all things chiefly to be dreaded.—Mr. Malthus seems fully aware of
the importance of the stage-maxim, To elevate and surprise. Having
once heated the imaginations of his readers, he knows that he can
afterwards mould them into whatever shape he pleases. All this
bustle and terror, and stage-effect, and theatrical mummery was only
to serve a temporary purpose, for all of a sudden the scene is shifted,
and the storm subsides. Having frighted away the boldest champions
of modern philosophy, this monstrous appearance, full of strange and
inexplicable horrors, is suffered quietly to shrink back to its natural
dimensions, and we find it to be nothing more than a common-sized
tame looking animal, which however requires a chain and the whip
of its keeper to prevent it from becoming mischievous. Mr. Malthus
then steps forward and says, ‘The evil we were all in danger of was
not population,—but philosophy. Nothing is to be done with the
latter by mere reasoning. I, therefore, thought it right to make use
of a little terror to accomplish the end. As to the principle of
population you need be under no alarm; only leave it to me, and I
shall be able to manage it very well. All its dreadful consequences
may be easily prevented by a proper application of the motives of
common prudence and common decency.’ If, however, any one
should be at a loss to know how it is possible to reconcile such
contradictions, I would suggest to Mr. Malthus the answer which
Hamlet makes to his friend Guildenstern, ‘’Tis as easy as lying:
govern these ventiges (the poor-rates and private charity) with your
fingers and thumb, and this same instrument will discourse most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>excellent music; look you, here are the stops,’ (namely, Mr.
Malthus’s Essay and Mr. Whitbread’s Poor Bill).<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c011'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c003'>ON THE APPLICATION OF MR. MALTHUS’S PRINCIPLE TO THE POOR LAWS</h3>

<p class='c008'>In speaking of the abolition of the Poor Laws, Mr. Malthus
says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘To this end, I should propose a regulation to be made, declaring,
that no child born from any marriage, taking place after the expiration
of a year from the date of the law, and no illegitimate child born two
years from the same date, should ever be entitled to parish assistance.
And to give a more general knowledge of this law, and to enforce it
more strongly on the minds of the lower classes of people, the clergyman
of each parish should, after the publication of banns, read a short
address, stating the strong obligation on every man to support his
own children; the impropriety, and even immorality, of marrying
without a prospect of being able to do this; the evils which had
resulted to the poor themselves from the attempt which had been
made to assist by public institutions in a duty which ought to be
exclusively appropriated to parents; and the absolute necessity which
had at length appeared of abandoning all such institutions, on account
of their producing effects totally opposite to those which were
intended.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘This would operate as a fair, distinct, and precise notice, which
no man could well mistake, and, without pressing hard on any
particular individuals, would at once throw off the rising generation
from that miserable and helpless dependence upon the government
and the rich, the moral as well as physical consequences of which
are almost incalculable.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘After the public notice which I have proposed had been given,
and the system of poor-laws had ceased with regard to the rising
generation, if any man chose to marry, without a prospect of being
able to support a family, he should have the most perfect liberty so
to do. Though to marry, in this case, is, in my opinion, clearly an
immoral act, yet it is not one which society can justly take upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>itself to prevent or punish; because the punishment provided for it
by the laws of nature falls directly and most severely upon the
individual who commits the act, and through him, only more remotely
and feebly, on the society. When Nature will govern and punish
for us, it is a very miserable ambition to wish to snatch the rod from
her hands, and draw upon ourselves the odium of executioner. To
the punishment therefore of Nature he should be left, the punishment
of want. He has erred in the face of a most clear and precise
warning, and can have no just reason to complain of any persons but
himself when he feels the consequences of his error. All parish
assistance should be most rigidly denied him; and he should be left
to the uncertain support of private charity. He should be taught to
know, that the laws of Nature, which are the laws of God, had
doomed him and his family to starve,<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c011'><sup>[67]</sup></a> for disobeying their repeated
admonitions; that he had no claim of <em>right</em> on society for the smallest
portion of food, beyond that which his labour would fairly purchase;
and that if he and his family were saved from feeling the natural
consequences of his imprudence, he would owe it to the pity of some
kind benefactor, to whom, therefore, he ought to be bound by the
strongest ties of gratitude.’</p>

<p class='c010'>This passage has been well answered by Mr. Cobbett in one word,
‘Parson’;—the most expressive apostrophe that ever was made; and
it might be answered as effectually by another word, which I shall
omit. When Mr. Malthus asserts, that the poor man and his family
have been doomed to starve by the laws of nature, which are the
laws of God, he means by the laws of God and nature, the physical
and necessary inability of the earth to supply food for more than a
certain number of human beings; but if he means that the wants of
the poor arise from the impossibility of procuring food for them, while
the rich roll in abundance, or, we will say, maintain their dogs and
horses, &amp;c. out of their ostentatious superfluities, he asserts what he
knows not to be true. Mr. Malthus wishes to confound the necessary
limits of the produce of the earth with the arbitrary and artificial
distribution of that produce according to the institutions of society, or
the caprice of individuals, the laws of God and nature with the laws
of man. And what proves the fallacy is, that the laws of man in
the present case actually afford the relief, which he would wilfully
deny; he proposes to repeal those laws, and then to tell the poor
man impudently, that ‘the laws of God and nature have doomed
him and his family to starve, for disobeying their repeated admonitions,’
stuck on the church-door for the last twelve months! ’Tis
much.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>I have in a separate work made the following remarks on the
above proposal, which are a little cavalier, not too cavalier;—a little
contemptuous, not too contemptuous; a little gross, but not too gross
for the subject.—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I am not sorry that I am at length come to this passage. It will
I hope decide the reader’s opinion of the benevolence, wisdom, piety,
candour, and disinterested simplicity of Mr. Malthus’s mind. Any
comments that I might make upon it to strengthen this impression
must be faint and feeble. I give up the task of doing justice to the
moral beauties that pervade every line of it, in despair. There are
some instances of an heroical contempt for the narrow prejudices of
the world, of a perfect refinement from the vulgar feelings of human
nature, that must only suffer by a comparison with any thing else.</p>

<p class='c010'>I shall not myself be so uncandid as not to confess, that I think
the poor laws bad things; and that it would be well, if they could be
got rid of, consistently with humanity and justice. This I do not
think they could in the present state of things, and other circumstances
remaining as they are. The reason why I object to Mr. Malthus’s
plan is, that it does not go to the root of the evil, or attack it in its
principle, but its effects. He confounds the cause with the effect.
The wide spreading tyranny, dependence, indolence, and unhappiness,
of which Mr. Malthus is so sensible, are not occasioned by the
increase of the poor-rates, but these are the natural consequence of
that increasing tyranny, dependence, indolence, and unhappiness occasioned
by other causes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Malthus desires his readers to look at the enormous proportion
in which the poor-rates have increased within the last ten years. But
have they increased in any greater proportion than the other taxes,
which rendered them necessary, and, which I think, were employed
for much more mischievous purposes? I would ask, what have the
poor got by their encroachments for the last ten years? Do they
work less hard? Are they better fed? Do they marry oftener,
and with better prospects? Are they grown pampered and insolent?
Have they changed places with the rich? Have they been cunning
enough, by means of the poor-laws, to draw off all their wealth and
superfluities from the men of property? Have they got so much as
a quarter of an hour’s leisure, a farthing candle, or a cheese-paring
more than they had? Has not the price of provisions risen enormously?
Has not the price of labour almost stood still? Have
not the government and the rich had their way in every thing?
Have they not gratified their ambition, their pride, their obstinacy,
their ruinous extravagance? Have they not squandered the resources
of the country as they pleased? Have they not heaped up wealth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>on themselves, and their dependents? Have they not multiplied
sinecures, places, and pensions? Have they not doubled the salaries
of those that existed before? Has there been any want of new
creations of peers, who would thus be impelled to beget heirs to
their titles and estates, and saddle the younger branches of their
rising families, by means of their new influence, on the country at
large? Has there been any want of contracts, of loans, of monopolies
of corn, of a good understanding between the rich and the powerful
to assist one another, and to fleece the poor? Have the poor prospered?
Have the rich declined? What then have they to complain
of? What ground is there for the apprehension, that wealth is
secretly changing hands, and that the whole property of the country
will shortly be absorbed in the poor’s fund? Do not the poor create
their own fund? Is not the necessity for such a fund first occasioned
by the unequal weight with which the rich press upon the poor; and
has not the increase of that fund in the last ten years been occasioned
by the additional exorbitant demands, which have been made upon the
poor and industrious, which, without some assistance from the public,
they could not possibly have answered? Whatever is the increase in
the nominal amount of the poor’s fund, will not the rich always be
able ultimately to throw the burthen of it on the poor themselves?
But Mr. Malthus is a man of general principles. He cares little about
these circumstantial details, and petty objections. He takes higher
ground. He deduces all his conclusions, by an infallible logic, from
the laws of God and nature. When our Essayist shall prove to me,
that by these paper bullets of the brain, by his ratios of the increase of
food, and the increase of mankind, he has prevented one additional
tax, or taken off one oppressive duty, that he has made a single rich
man retrench one article at his table: that he has made him keep
a dog or a horse the less, or part with a single vice, arguing from
a mathematical admeasurement of the size of the earth, and the
number of inhabitants it can contain, he shall have my perfect leave
to disclaim the right of the poor to subsistence, and to tie them down
by severe penalties to their good behaviour, on the same profound
principles. But why does Mr. Malthus practise his demonstrations
on the poor only? Why are they to have a perfect system of rights
and duties prescribed to them? I do not see why they alone should
be put to live on these metaphysical board-wages, why they should be
forced to submit to a course of <em>abstraction</em>; or why it should be meat
and drink to them, more than to others, to do the will of God.
Mr. Malthus’s gospel is preached only to the poor!—Even if I
approved of our author’s plan, I should object to the principle on
which it is founded. The parson of the parish, when a poor man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>comes to be married—No, not so fast. The author does not say,
whether the lecture he proposes is to be read to the poor only, or to
all ranks of people. Would it not sound oddly, if when the squire,
who is himself worth a hundred thousand pounds, is going to be
married to the rector’s daughter, who is to have fifty, the curate
should read them a formal lecture on their obligation to maintain their
own children and not turn them on the parish? Would it be necessary
to go through the form of the address, when an amorous couple
of eighty presented themselves at the altar? If the admonition were
left to the parson’s own discretion, what affronts would he not
subject himself to, from his neglect of old maids, and superannuated
widows, and from his applying himself familiarly to the little shopkeeper,
or thriving mechanic? Well, then, let us suppose that a
very poor hard-working man comes to be married, and that the
clergyman can take the liberty with him: he is to warn him first
against fornication, and in the next place against matrimony. These
are the two greatest sins which a poor man can commit, who can
neither be supposed to keep his wife, nor his girl. Mr. Malthus,
however, does not think them equal: for he objects strongly to a
country fellow’s marrying a girl whom he has debauched, or, as the
phrase is, making an honest woman of her, as aggravating the crime;
because, by this means, the parish will probably have three or four
children to maintain instead of one. However, as it seems rather
too late to give advice to a man who is actually come to be married,
it is most natural to suppose that he would marry the young woman
in spite of the lecture. Here then he errs in the face of a precise
warning, and should be left to the punishment of <em>nature</em>, the punishment
of severe want. When he begins to feel the consequences
of his error, all parish assistance is to be rigidly denied him, and
the interests of humanity imperiously require that all other assistance
should be withheld from him, or most sparingly administered. In
the meantime, to reconcile him to this treatment, and let him see
that he has nobody to complain of but himself, the parson of the
parish comes to him with the certificate of his marriage, and a copy
of the warning he had given him at the time, by which he is taught
to know that the laws of nature, which are the laws of God, had
doomed him and his family to starve for disobeying their repeated
admonitions; that he had no claim of right to the smallest portion of
food beyond what his labour would actually purchase; and that he
ought to kiss the feet and lick the dust off the shoes of him, who
gave him a reprieve from the just sentence which the laws of God
and nature had passed upon him. To make this clear to him, it
would be necessary to put the Essay on Population into his hands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>to instruct him in the nature of a geometrical and arithmetical series,
in the necessary limits to population from the size of the earth; and
here would come in Mr. Malthus’s plan of education for the poor,
writing, arithmetic, the use of the globes, &amp;c. for the purpose of
proving to them the necessity of their being starved. It cannot be
supposed that the poor man (what with his poverty and what with
being priest-ridden) should be able to resist this body of evidence,
he would open his eyes to his error, and “would submit to the
sufferings that were absolutely irremediable, with the fortitude of
a man, and the resignation of a Christian.” He and his family
might then be sent round the parish in a starving condition, accompanied
by the constables and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quondam</span></i> overseers of the poor, to see
that no person, blind to “the interests of humanity,” practised upon
them the abominable deception of attempting to relieve their remediless
sufferings; and by the parson of the parish, to point out to the
spectators the inevitable consequences of sinning against the laws of
God and man. By celebrating a number of these <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Auto da fes</span></i> yearly
in every parish, the greatest publicity would be given to the principle
of population, “the strict line of duty would be pointed out to every
man,” enforced by the most powerful sanctions; justice and humanity
would flourish, they would be understood to signify that the poor
have no right to live by their labour, and that the feelings of compassion
and benevolence are best shewn by denying them charity;
the poor would no longer be dependent on the rich, the rich could
no longer wish to reduce the poor into a more complete subjection
to their will, all causes of contention, of jealousy, and of irritation
would have ceased between them, the struggle would be over, each
class would fulfil the task assigned by heaven; the rich would
oppress the poor without remorse, the poor would submit to oppression
with a pious gratitude and resignation; the greatest harmony would
prevail between the government and the people; there would be
no longer any seditions, tumults, complaints, petitions, partisans of
liberty, or tools of power; no grumbling, no repining, no discontented
men of talents proposing reforms, and frivolous remedies, but we
should all have the same gaiety and lightness of heart, and the same
happy spirit of resignation that a man feels when he is seized with
the plague, who thinks no more of the physician, but knows that his
disorder is without cure. The best-laid schemes are subject, however,
to unlucky reverses. Some such seem to lie in the way of that
pleasing Euthanasia, and contented submission to the grinding law
of necessity, projected by Mr. Malthus. We might never reach the
philosophic temper of the inhabitants of modern Greece and Turkey
in this respect. Many little things might happen to interrupt our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>progress, if we were put into ever so fair a train. For instance,
the men might perhaps be talked over by the parson, and their
understandings being convinced by the geometrical and arithmetical
ratios, or at least so far puzzled, that they would have nothing to
say for themselves, they might prepare to submit to their fate with
a tolerable grace. But I am afraid that the women might prove
refractory. They never will hearken to reason, and are much
more governed by their feelings than by calculations. While the
husband was instructing his wife in the principles of population,
she might probably answer that “she did not see why her children
should starve, when the squire’s lady or the parson’s lady kept
half a dozen lap-dogs, and that it was but the other day, that being
at the hall, or the parsonage-house, she heard Miss declare that
not one of the brood that were just littered should be drowned—It
was <em>so inhuman</em> to kill the poor little things—Surely the
children of the poor are as good as puppy-dogs! Was it not a
week ago that the rector had a new pack of terriers sent down,
and did I not hear the squire swear a tremendous oath, that he
would have Mr. Such-a-one’s fine hunter, if it cost him a hundred
guineas? Half that sum would save us from ruin.”—After this
curtain-lecture, I conceive that the husband might begin to doubt the
force of the demonstrations he had read and heard, and the next
time his clerical monitor came, might pluck up courage to question
the matter with him; and as we of the male sex, though dull of
apprehension, are not slow at taking a hint, and can draw tough
inferences from it, it is not impossible but the parson might be
<em>gravelled</em>. In consequence of these accidents happening more than
once, it would be buzzed about that the laws of God and nature, on
which so many families had been doomed to starve, were not so
clear as had been pretended. This would soon get wind amongst the
mob: and at the next grand procession of the Penitents of famine,
headed by Mr. Malthus in person, some discontented man of talents,
who could not bear the distresses of others with the fortitude of a
man and the resignation of a Christian, might undertake to question
Mr. Malthus, whether the laws of nature or of God, to which he
had piously sacrificed so many victims, signified any thing more than
the limited extent of the earth, and the natural impossibility of
providing for more than a limited number of human beings; and
whether those laws could be justly put in force, to the very letter,
while the actual produce of the earth, by being better husbanded,
or more equally distributed, or given to men and not to beasts, might
maintain in comfort double the number that actually existed, and who,
not daring to demand a <em>fair</em> proportion of the produce of their labour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>humbly crave charity, and are refused out of regard to the interests of
justice and humanity. Our philosopher, at this critical juncture not
being able to bring into the compass of a few words all the history,
metaphysics, morality, and divinity, or all the intricacies, subtleties,
and callous equivocations contained in his quarto volume, might
hesitate and be confounded—his own feelings and prejudices might
add to his perplexity—his interrogator might persist in his question—the
mob might become impatient for an answer, and not finding one to
their minds, might proceed to extremities. Our unfortunate Essayist
(who by that time would have become a bishop) might be ordered to
the lamp-post, and his book committed to the flames,—I tremble to
think of what would follow:—the poor-laws would be again renewed,
and the poor no longer doomed to starve by the laws of God and
nature! Some such, I apprehend, might be the consequences of
attempting to enforce the abolition of the poor-laws, the extinction of
private charity, and of instructing the poor in their metaphysical
rights.’</p>

<h3 class='c003'>QUERIES RELATING TO THE ESSAY ON POPULATION</h3>

<p class='c008'>Query 1. Whether the real source of Mr. Malthus’s Essay is not to
be found in a work published in the year 1761, entitled, ‘Various
Prospects of Mankind,’ by a Scotchman of the name of Wallace?
Or whether this writer has not both stated the principle of the disproportion
between the unlimited power of increase in population, and
the limited power of increase in the means of subsistence, which
principle is the corner-stone of the Essay; and whether he has not
drawn the very same inference from it that Mr. Malthus has done,
viz. that vice and misery are necessary to keep population down to the
level of the means of subsistence?</p>

<p class='c010'>2. Whether the chapter in Wallace, written expressly to prove
these two points (or in other words, to shew that the principle of
population is necessarily incompatible with any great degree of
improvement in government or morals) does not completely anticipate
Mr. Malthus’s work, both in its principle and its conclusion?</p>

<p class='c010'>3. Whether the idea of an arithmetical and geometrical series by
which Mr. Malthus has been thought to have furnished the precise
rule or <em>calculus</em> of the disproportion between food and population, is
not, strictly speaking, inapplicable to the subject; inasmuch as in new
and lately occupied countries, the quantity of food may be made to
increase nearly in the same proportion as population, and in all old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>and well cultivated countries must be stationary, or nearly so?
Whether, therefore, this mode of viewing the subject has not tended
as much to embarrass as to illustrate the question, and to divert the
mind from the real source of the only necessary distinction between
food and population, namely, the want of sufficient room for the
former to grow in; a grain of corn, as long as it has room to increase
and multiply, in fact propagating its species much faster even than
a man?</p>

<p class='c010'>4. Whether the argument borrowed from Wallace, and constituting
the chief scope and tenor of the first edition of the Essay,
which professed to overturn all schemes of human perfectibility and
Utopian forms of government from the sole principle of population,
does not involve a plain contradiction;—both these authors, first of
all, supposing or taking for granted a state of society in which the
most perfect order, wisdom, virtue, and happiness shall prevail, and
then endeavouring to shew that all these advantages would only hasten
their own ruin, and end in famine, confusion, and unexampled
wretchedness, in consequence of taking away the only possible checks
to population, <em>vice</em> and <em>misery</em>? Whether this objection does not
suppose mankind in a state of the most perfect reason, to be utterly
blind to the consequences of the unrestrained indulgence of their
appetites, and with the most perfect wisdom and virtue regulating all
their actions, not to have the slightest command over their animal
passions? There is nothing in any of the visionary schemes of
human perfection so idle as this objection brought against them, which
has no more to do with the reasonings of Godwin, Condorcet, &amp;c.
(against which Mr. Malthus’s first Essay was directed) than with the
prophecies of the Millennium!</p>

<p class='c010'>5. Whether, in order to give some colour of plausibility to his
argument, and to prove that the highest conceivable degree of wisdom
and virtue could be of no avail in keeping down the principle of
population, Mr. Malthus did not at first set out with representing this
principle, to wit, the impulse to propagate the species, as a law of the
same order and cogency as that of satisfying the cravings of hunger;
so that reason having no power over it, vice and misery must be the
necessary consequences, and only possible checks to population?</p>

<p class='c010'>6. Whether this original view of the subject did not unavoidably
lead to the most extravagant conclusions, not only by representing the
total removal of all vice and misery as the greatest evil that could
happen to the world, but (what is of more consequence than this
speculative paradox) by throwing a suspicion and a stigma on all
subordinate improvements or plans of reform, as so many clauses or
sections of the same general principle? Whether the quantity of vice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>and misery necessary to keep population down to the level of the
means of subsistence, being left quite undetermined by the author, the
old barriers between vice and virtue, good and evil, were not broken
down, and a perfect latitude of choice allowed between forms of
government and modes of society, according to the temper of the
times, or the taste of individuals; only that vice and misery being
always the <em>safe side</em>, the presumption would naturally be in favour of
the most barbarous, ignorant, enslaved, and profligate? Whether the
stumbling-block thus thrown in the way of those who aimed at any
amendment in social institutions, does not obviously account for the
alarm and opposition which Mr. Malthus’s work excited on the one
hand, and for the cordiality and triumph with which it was hailed on
the other?</p>

<p class='c010'>7. Whether this view of the question, which is all in which the
Essay differs fundamentally from the received and less startling
notions on the subject, is not palpably, and by the author’s subsequent
confession, false, sophistical, and unfounded?</p>

<p class='c010'>8. Whether the additional principle of <em>moral restraint</em>, inserted in
the second and following editions of the Essay as one effectual, and as
the only desirable means of checking population, does not at once
overturn all the paradoxical conclusions of the author respecting the
state of man in society, and whether nearly all these conclusions do
not still stand in Mr. Malthus’s work as they originally stood, as false
in fact as they are inconsistent in reasoning? Whether, indeed, it
was likely, that Mr. Malthus would give up the sweeping conclusions
of his first Essay, the fruits of his industry and the pledges of his
success, without great reluctance; or in such a manner as not to leave
the general plan of his work full of contradictions and almost
unintelligible?</p>

<p class='c010'>9. Whether, for example, in treating of the durability of a perfect
form of government, Mr. Malthus has not ‘sicklied over the subject
with the same pale and jaundiced cast of thought,’ by supposing vice
and misery to be the only effectual checks to population; and in his
tenacity on this his old and favourite doctrine, whether he has not
formally challenged his opponents to point out any other, ‘except
indeed’ (he adds, recollecting himself) ‘moral restraint,’ which
however he considers as of no effect at all?</p>

<p class='c010'>10. Whether, consistently with this verbal acknowledgment and
virtual rejection of the influence of moral causes, the general tendency
of Mr. M.’s system is not to represent the actual state of man in
society as nothing better than a blind struggle between vice, misery,
and the principle of population, the effects of which are just as
mechanical as the ebbing and flowing of the tide, and to bury all other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>principles, all knowledge, or virtue, or liberty, under a heap of
misapplied facts?</p>

<p class='c010'>11. Whether, instead of accounting for the different degrees of
happiness, plenty, populousness, &amp;c. in different countries, or in the
same country at different periods, from good or bad government,
from the vicissitudes of manners, civilization, and knowledge, according
to the common prejudice, Mr. Malthus does not expressly and
repeatedly declare that political institutions are but as the dust in the
balance compared with the inevitable consequences of the principle of
population; and whether he does not treat with the utmost contempt
all those, who not being in the secret of ‘the grinding law of
necessity,’ had before his time superficially concluded that moral,
political, religious, and other positive causes were of considerable
weight in determining the happiness or misery of mankind? It were
to be wished that the author, instead of tampering with his subject,
and alternately holding out concessions, and then recalling them, had
made one bold and honest effort to get rid of the bewildering effects
of his original system, by affording his readers some clue to determine,
both in what manner and to what extent other causes, independent of
the principle of population, actually combine with that principle (no
longer pretended to be absolute and uncontroulable) to vary the face
of nature and society, under the same general law, and had not left
this most important <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">desideratum</span></i> in his work, to be apocryphally
supplied by the ingenuity and zeal of his apologists?</p>

<p class='c010'>12. Whether Mr. Malthus does not uniformly discourage every
plan for extending the limits of population, and consequently the
sphere of human enjoyment, either by cultivating new tracts of soil,
or improving the old ones, by repeating on all occasions the same
stale, senseless objection, that, <em>after all</em>, the principle of population
will press as much as ever on the means of subsistence; or in other
words, that though the means of subsistence and comfort will be
increased, there will be a proportionable increase in the number of
those who are to partake of it? Or whether Mr. Malthus’s panic
fear on this subject has not subsided into an equally unphilosophical
indifference?</p>

<p class='c010'>13. Whether the principle of moral restraint, formerly recognized
in Mr. Malthus’s latter writings, and in reality turning all his
paradoxes into mere impertinence, does not remain a dead letter,
which he never calls into action, except for the single purpose of
torturing the poor under pretence of reforming their morals?</p>

<p class='c010'>14. Whether the avowed basis of the author’s system on the poor-laws,
is not the following:—that by the laws of God and nature, the
rich have a right to starve the poor whenever they (the poor) cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>maintain themselves; and whether the deliberate sophistry by which
this right is attempted to be made out, is not as gross an insult on the
understanding as on the feelings of the public? Or whether this
reasoning does not consist in a trite truism and a wilful contradiction;
the truism being, that whenever the earth cannot maintain all its
inhabitants, that then, by the laws of God and nature, or the physical
constitution of things, some of them must perish; and the contradiction
being, that the right of the rich to withhold a morsel of bread
from the poor, while they themselves roll in abundance, is a law of
God and nature, founded on the same physical necessity or absolute
deficiency in the means of subsistence?</p>

<p class='c010'>15. Whether the commentators on the Essay have not fallen
into the same unwarrantable mode of reasoning, by confounding the
real funds for the maintenance of labour, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> the actual produce of the
soil, with the scanty pittance allowed out of it for the maintenance of
the labourer (after the demands of luxury and idleness are satisfied)
by the positive, varying laws of every country, or by the caprice of
individuals?</p>

<p class='c010'>16. Whether these two things are not fundamentally distinct in
themselves, and ought not to be kept so, in a question of such
importance, as the right of the rich to starve the poor by system?</p>

<p class='c010'>17. Whether Mr. Malthus has not been too much disposed to
consider the rich as a sort of Gods upon earth, who were merely
employed in distributing the goods of nature and fortune among the
poor, who themselves neither ate nor drank, ‘neither married nor
were given in marriage,’ and consequently were altogether unconcerned
in the limited extent of the means of subsistence, and the unlimited
increase of population?</p>

<p class='c010'>18. Lastly, whether the whole of the reverend author’s management
of the principle of population and of the necessity of moral
restraint, does not seem to have been copied from the prudent Friar’s
advice in Chaucer?</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This work was published in two 8vo volumes in 1807 with the following title-page:
‘The Eloquence of the British Senate; or, Select Specimens from the
Speeches of the most Distinguished Parliamentary Speakers. From the beginning
of the Reign of Charles I. to the Present Time. With Notes, Biographical,
Critical, and Explanatory. Two Volumes. London: Printed for Thomas Ostell,
No. 3, Ave Maria Lane, Ludgate St. 1807.’ In the following year the work
appeared with another title-page, which contains the same title, and proceeds
‘By William Hazlitt. In Two Volumes. London: Printed for J. Murray,
Fleet-Street, and J. Harding, St. James’s-Street, London; and A. Constable and
Co., Edinburgh. 1808.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>This collection took its rise from a wish which the compiler had sometimes
felt, in hearing the praises of the celebrated orators of former
times, to know what figure they would have made by the side of those
of our own times, with whose productions we are better acquainted.
For instance, in reading Burke, I should have been glad to have had
the speeches of Lord Chatham at hand, to compare them; and I
have had the same curiosity to know, whether Walpole had any thing
like the dexterity and plausibility of Pitt. As there are probably
other readers, who may have felt the same kind of curiosity, I
thought I could not employ my time better than in attempting to
gratify it. Besides, it is no more than a piece of justice due to the
<em>mighty dead</em>. It is but right we should know what we owe to them,
and how far we have improved upon, or fallen short of them. Who
could not give almost any thing to have seen Garrick, and Betterton,
and Quin? Our politicians are almost as short-lived a race as our
players, ‘who strut and fret an hour upon the stage, and then are
heard no more.’ The event, and the hero of the moment, engross
all our attention, and in the <em>vastness</em> of our present views, we entirely
overlook the past. Those celebrated men of the last age, the Walpoles,
the Pulteneys, the Pelhams, the Harleys, the Townshends,
and the Norths, who filled the columns of the newspapers with their
speeches, and every pot-house with their fame, who were the mouthpieces
of their party, nothing but perpetual smoke and bounce,
incessant volley without let or intermission, who were the wisdom
of the wise, and the strength of the strong, whose praises were
inscribed on every window-shutter or brick-wall, or floated through
the busy air, upborne by the shouts and huzzas of a giddy multitude,—all
of them are now silent and forgotten; all that remains of them
is consigned to oblivion in the musty records of Parliament, or lives
only in the shadow of a name. I wished therefore to bring them on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>the stage once more, and drag them out of that obscurity, from which
it is now impossible to redeem their <em>fellow-actors</em>. I was uneasy till
I had made the monumental pile of octavos and folios, ‘wherein I
saw them quietly inurned, open its ponderous and marble jaws,’ and
‘set the imprisoned wranglers free again.’ It is possible that some
of that numerous race of orators, who have sprung up within the last
ten years, to whom I should certainly have first paid my compliments,
may not be satisfied with the space allotted them in these volumes.
But I cannot help it. My object was to revive what was forgotten,
and embody what was permanent; and not to echo the loquacious
babblings of these accomplished persons, who, if all their words were
written in a book, the world would not contain them. Besides,
living speakers may, and are in the habit of printing their own
speeches. Or even if this were not the case, there is no danger,
while they have breath and lungs left, that they will ever suffer the
public to be at a loss for daily specimens of their polished eloquence
and profound wisdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were some other objects to be attended to in making this
collection, as well as the style of different speakers. I wished to
make it a history, as far as I could, of the progress of the language,
of the state of parties at different periods, of the most interesting
debates, and in short, an abridged parliamentary history for the time.
It was necessary that it should serve as a common-place book of all
the principal topics, of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pros</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cons</span></i> of the different questions,
that may be brought into dispute. If, however, this work has the
effect which I intend it to have, it will rather serve to put a stop to
that vice of <em>much speaking</em>, which is the fashion of the present day,
by shewing our forward disputants how little new is to be said on
any of these questions, than offer a temptation to their vanity to
enrich themselves out of the spoils of others. I have also endeavoured
to gratify the reader’s curiosity, by sometimes giving the speeches of
men who were not celebrated for their eloquence, but for other
things; as Cromwell, for example. If, therefore, any one expects
to find nothing but eloquent speeches in these volumes, he will
certainly be disappointed. A very small volume indeed, would contain
all the recorded eloquence of both houses of parliament.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to the notes and criticisms, which accompany the speeches, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>am aware that they are too long and frequent for a work of this
nature. If, however, the reader should not be of opinion that ‘the
things themselves are neither new nor rare,’ he is at liberty to apply
the next line of the satire to them,—he may naturally enough wonder,
‘how the devil they got there.’ The characters of Chatham, Burke,
Fox, and Pitt, are those which are the most laboured. As to the
first of these, I am not so certain. It was written in the heat of the
first impression which his speeches made upon me: and perhaps
the first impression is a fair test of the effect they must produce on
those who heard them.—But farther I will not be answerable for it.
As to the opinions I have expressed of the three last speakers, they
are at least my settled opinions, and I believe I shall not easily change
them. In the selections from Burke, I have followed the advice of
friends in giving a whole speech, whereas I ought to have given only
extracts.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the bias which may sometimes appear in this work, I shall
only apologize by referring the impartial reader to the different
characters of Fox and Burke. These will, I think, shew, that
whatever my prejudices may be, I am not much disposed to be
blinded by them.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTES</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>King Charles I.</span>—Came to the crown in 1625, and was beheaded
in 1648. The following is his speech from the throne on meeting
his first parliament. It contains nothing very remarkable, but may
serve as a specimen of the stile that was in use at the time. The
chief subject of the speech is the war with Spain, in which the
country was then engaged. There is also an allusion to the plague,
which at that time prevailed in London.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Edward Coke</span>, (<em>Lord Chief Justice, and author of the Institutes</em>,)
was born in 1550, and died in 1634. He was removed from his
office in 1616, and first joined the popular side in parliament in
1621. There is the same quaintness and pithiness in the other
speeches which are given of this celebrated lawyer, that will be
found in the following one. It is a little remarkable, that almost
all the abuses of expenditure, and heads of œconomical reform,
which were the objects of Mr. Burke’s famous bill, are here
distinctly enumerated.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Robert Cotton</span>, (<em>the famous Antiquary</em>,) was born in 1570, and
died 1631. He was made a baronet by James <span class='fss'>I.</span> and was one of the
opposition party in the time of his successor. The speech which
follows was occasioned by some offence taken by the court at the
severe reflections cast upon the duke of Buckingham in the house of
commons. It is, as one might expect, learned, full of facts and
authorities, containing matters which no doubt were thought to be of
great weight and moment.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>George Villiers</span>, (<em>Created Duke of Buckingham by James I.</em>,)
was born 1592, and was assassinated by Felton in 1628. It is
said that he had originally but an indifferent education. Perhaps
it was owing to this that there is more ease and vivacity, and less
pedantry, in the stile of his speeches, than in those of most of
his contemporaries. We can hardly account for it from his having
been privately tutored by king James the First. The subject of
the following speech was the war with Spain, and recovery of the
Palatinate.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span><span class='sc'>Dr. John Williams</span>, (<em>Keeper of the Great Seal</em>, <em>Bishop of Lincoln</em>,
<em>and afterwards Archbishop of York</em>,) was born in Caernarvonshire in
Wales in 1582, and died in 1650. He preached James the First’s
funeral sermon, in which he compared him to king Solomon. How
well he was qualified for this courtly task may be seen by the following
specimen.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following speech I have thought worth preserving, as it
pretty clearly shews the relation which at this time was understood
to subsist, and the tone that prevailed, between the king and his
parliament.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Heneage Finch</span> was recorder of London. I have given his
speech on being appointed speaker, as a curious instance of the
flowery stile then in vogue. It is full of far-fetched thoughts, and
fulsome compliments.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>John Selden</span>, (<em>The well-known Author of Table-Talk, and other
works of great learning</em>,) was born in 1584, and died in 1654.
He was member at different times for Great Bedwin, in Wiltshire,
and Lancashire, and through his whole life a strenuous oppositionist.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Dudley Digges</span>, born in 1583, was made master of the rolls
in 1636, and died in 1639. I have already given one or two
specimens of the pompous stile; but as the following extract soars to
a still sublimer pitch, I could not resolve to omit it. After a slight
introduction to the charge brought forward against the duke of
Buckingham, his titles were formally enumerated, and then Sir
Dudley Digges proceeded.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. John Pym</span>, one of the great leaders of the republican party,
was member for Tavistock. He died in 1643. The subject of the
speech is the charge against the duke of Buckingham, of which he
was one of the managers. It certainly contains a great deal of good
sense, strongly expressed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. Wandesford.</span>—This long and closely reasoned speech about a
posset-drink, and sticking-plaister, applied by the duke of Buckingham
to James <span class='fss'>I.</span> a little before his death, is a proof of the gravity
with which our ancestors could treat the meanest subjects, when they
were connected with serious consequences.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Dudley Carleton.</span>—One may collect from the following
speech of Sir Dudley Carleton’s that he was a great traveller, and a
very well-meaning man. He was born 1573, and died 1631.
Before his death he was created Viscount Dorchester.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span><span class='sc'>Mr. Creskeld.</span>—If the thoughts in the following introduction to
an elaborate legal dissertation are conceits, they are nevertheless
ingenious and poetical conceits.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Robert Rich</span>, (<em>Created Earl of Warwick, and Lord Rich of Leeze,
by James <span class='fss'>I.</span></em>).—I have given the following speech on the right of the
crown to imprison the subject without any reason shewn, for its good
sense and logical acuteness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Francis Rouse</span> was a native of Cornwall. He represented Truro
in the long parliament, was one of the lay members of the assembly
of divines, and speaker of Barebone’s parliament, and died in 1659.
His speech against a Dr. Manwaring, who had written a flaming
monarchical sermon, is so remarkable for its fanatical absurdity, and
the uncouthness of the stile, that it certainly deserves a place in this
collection, as a curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir John Elliott.</span>—The following is a noble instance of parliamentary
eloquence; for the strength and closeness of the reasoning,
for the clearness of the detail, for the earnestness of the stile, it is
admirable: it in some places reminds one strongly of the clear, plain,
convincing, irresistible appeals of Demosthenes to his hearers. There
is no affectation of wit, no studied ornament, no display of fancied
superiority; his whole heart and soul are in his subject, he is full of
it; his mind seems as it were to surround and penetrate every part
of it; nothing diverts him from his purpose, or interrupts the course
of his reasoning for a moment. The force and connection of his
ideas give vehemence to his expressions, and he convinces others,
because he is thoroughly impressed with the truth of his own
opinions. A certain political writer of the present day might be
supposed to have borrowed his <em>dogged</em> stile from this speaker.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Benjamin Rudyard</span> was member for Wilton. That which is
here given is by far the best speech of his extant. It might pass for
the heads of one of Burke’s speeches, without the ornaments and
without the elegance. It has all the good sense, and moral wisdom,
only more plain and practical.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Robert Philips.</span>—In this apparently unstudied address, we
meet, for the first time, with real warmth and eloquence.</p>

<p class='c010'>This gentleman was not one of those who make speeches out of
mere parade and ostentation; he never spoke but when he was in
earnest, nor indeed till he was in a downright passion.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span><span class='sc'>Edmund Waller</span> (<em>The celebrated Poet</em>,) was born in 1605, and
died in 1687. He was member for St. Ives. At first he was
hostile to the court; but he seems to have been very wavering and
undecided in his political opinions, and changed his party very often,
according to his whim or convenience. I do not think there is any
thing in the following speech very excellent, either for the matter or
manner of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be hard to deny that the following speech is a good
one, when we know that it saved the author’s life. Indeed, nothing
can be imagined better calculated to soothe the resentment
of the house of commons, or flatter their pride, than the concluding
part of this address. Not even one of his own amorous heroes
could fawn and cringe, and swear and supplicate, and act a feigned
submission, with more suppleness and dexterity, to avert the mortal
displeasure of some proud and offended beauty, than Mr. Waller has
here employed to appease the fury, and insinuate himself once more
into the good graces of his political paramour, the house of commons.
In this, however, he succeeded no farther than to receive his life at
her hands; which it seems he had forfeited by conspiring to deliver
up the city to the king.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Lord George Digby</span>, (<em>Son of the first Earl of Bristol</em>,) was born
in 1612, and died in 1676. He was member for Dorsetshire in the
long parliament. He at first opposed the court, but afterwards joined
the royal party, and was expelled.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir John Wray</span>, (<em>Member for Lincolnshire</em>).—His speech is chiefly
remarkable for the great simplicity of the stile, and as an instance of
the manner in which an honest country gentleman, without much wit
or eloquence, but with some pretensions to both, might be supposed
to express himself at this period.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Thomas Wentworth</span>, (<em>Earl of Strafford</em>,) was a gentleman of an
ancient family in Yorkshire, and created a peer by Charles <span class='fss'>I</span>. He
at first opposed the court with great virulence and ability; but
afterwards became connected with it, and recommended some of
the most obnoxious measures. After a bill of attainder was passed
against him, at the instigation of the commons, the king refused for a
long time to give his assent to it, till at last lord Strafford himself
wrote to advise him to comply, which he did with great reluctance.
He was beheaded 1641. Whatever were his faults, he was a man
of a fine understanding, and an heroic spirit; and undoubtedly a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>great man. What follows is the conclusion of his last defence before
the house of lords.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Dr. Joseph Hall</span>, (<em>Bishop of Exeter and afterwards of Norwich</em>,)
was born in 1574, and died 1656. He suffered a good deal from
the Puritans. He is celebrated, without much reason, for the
fineness of his writings.</p>

<p class='c010'>This speech has more feeling in it than the Bishop generally discovers.
It shews that ‘passion makes men eloquent.’</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bulstrode Whitlocke</span>, (<em>Member for Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire</em>,)
was born in 1605, and died in 1676. In 1653 he was sent
ambassador to Sweden. He was a man of great learning, and he
appears also to have possessed moderation and good sense. He was
the author of the Memorials.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following speech displays so much knowledge, and such deep
research into the imperfect and obscure parts of English history,
that though it is long, and from the nature of the subject somewhat
uninteresting, I thought it right to let it stand, as a monument of
legal learning in the 17th century. A country may be as different
from itself, at different times, as one country is from another; and
one object that I have chiefly had in view in this work, has been
to select such examples as might serve to mark the successive
changes that have taken place in the minds and characters of Englishmen
within the last 200 years.</p>

<p class='c010'>The distinctive character of the period of which we are now
speaking was, I think, that men’s minds were stored with facts and
images, almost to excess; there was a tenacity and firmness in them
that kept fast hold of the impressions of things as they were first
stamped upon the mind; and ‘their ideas seemed to lie like substances
in the brain.’ Facts and feelings went hand in hand; the one
naturally implied the other; and our ideas, not yet exorcised and
squeezed and tortured out of their natural objects, into a subtle
essence of pure intellect, did not fly about like ghosts without a body,
tossed up and down, or upborne only by the <span class='fss'>ELEGANT FORMS</span> of words,
through the <em>vacuum</em> of abstract reasoning, and sentimental refinement.
The understanding was invigorated and nourished with its natural and
proper food, the knowledge of things without it; and was not left,
like an empty stomach, to prey upon itself, or starve on the meagre
scraps of an artificial logic, or windy impertinence of ingenuity
self-begotten. What a difference between the grave, clear, solid,
laborious stile of the speech here given, and the crude metaphysics,
false glitter, and trifling witticism of a modern legal oration! The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>truth is, that the affectation of philosophy and fine taste has spoiled
every thing; and instead of the honest seriousness and simplicity of
old English reasoning in law, in politics, in morality, in all the
grave concerns of life, we have nothing left but a mixed species of
bastard sophistry, got between ignorance and vanity, and generating
nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>William Lenthall</span>, (<em>An eminent Lawyer</em>, <em>and Speaker of the Long
Parliament</em>,) was member for Woodstock. He was born 1591, and
died 1662. This high-flown address to General Fairfax, is a model
of the adulatory stile. Surely a great man does not stand in need of
so much praise.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Oliver Cromwell</span>, (<em>Member for Cambridge</em>, <em>born 1599</em>, <em>died
1658</em>).—I have given the following speeches of his, to shew that
he was not so bad a speaker as is generally imagined. The world
will never (if they can help it) allow one man more than one
excellence; and if he possesses any one quality in the highest degree,
they then, either to excite a foolish wonder, or to gratify a lurking
vanity, endeavour to find out that he is as much below the rest of
mankind in every thing else. Thus it has been the fashion to
suppose, because Cromwell was a great general and statesman, that
therefore he could not utter a sentence that was intelligible, or that
had the least connection, or even common sense in it. But this is
not the fact. His speeches, though not remarkable either for their
elegance or clearness, are not remarkable for the contrary qualities.
They are pithy and sententious; containing many examples of strong
practical reason, (not indeed of that kind which is satisfied with
itself, and supplies the place of action) but always closely linked, and
serving as a prelude to action. His observations are those of a man
who does not rely entirely on words, and has some other resource left
him besides; but who is neither unwilling nor unable to employ them,
when they are necessary to his purpose. If they do not convey any
adequate idea of his great abilities, they contain nothing from which
one might infer the contrary. They are just such speeches as a man
must make with his hand upon his sword, and who appeals to that as
the best decider of controversies. They are full of bustle and
impatience, and always go directly to the point in debate, without
preparation or circumlocution.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>John Thurloe</span>, (<em>Author of the State Papers</em>, <em>and confidential
Secretary to Cromwell</em>,) was born in 1616, and died in 1668. The
following speech of his is interesting, as it shews the temper of the
times; it is shrewd and vulgar enough.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span><span class='sc'>Richard Cromwell</span>, succeeded his father in the Protectorate; but
soon after, not being able to retain the government in his hands, he
resigned, and went abroad. He died 1712. It is curious to have
something of a man who, from the weakness either of his understanding
or passions, tamely lost a kingdom which his father had gained.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Charles II.</span> was born 1630, and died 1685. This prince is justly
celebrated for his understanding and wit. There is, however, nothing
remarkable in his speeches to parliament, of which the following is a
very fair specimen.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Edward Hyde</span>, (<em>Earl of Clarendon</em>, <em>and Lord Chancellor of
England</em>,) was born in 1608, and died abroad in 1673. He was a
steady adherent to the royal party, but in 1667 he was accused of
treason, and obliged to withdraw secretly into France. He was a
man of great abilities, and wrote the well-known history of the
Rebellion. His daughter was married to James <span class='fss'>II</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>George Villiers</span>, (<em>Second Duke of Buckingham</em>,)—Born 1627, died
1688. He is famous for having written the satirical play of the
Rehearsal. His speech at a grave conference between the lords and
commons, to decide the limits of the judicial authority of the former,
is very like what one might expect from him. He seems chiefly
anxious to avoid the imputation of knowing or caring more about the
matter than became a gentleman, and a wit; at the same time he
talks very well about it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Lord Bristol.</span>—I have given the following Speech, because it
discovers a quaint sort of familiar common sense.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Heneage Finch</span>, (<em>First Earl of Nottingham</em>, <em>Son of Sir Heneage
Finch</em>,) was born 1621, and died 1682. He was member for
Oxford, and in 1670 appointed attorney general, and afterwards lord
keeper and lord chancellor. In this latter office he succeeded Lord
Clarendon. He was rather an elegant speaker.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Leoline Jenkins</span>, (<em>An eminent Civilian and Statesman</em>,) was
born in Glamorganshire, in 1623, and died 1685. He was one of
the representatives of the University of Oxford, and principal of
Jesus College.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Lord William Russell</span>, (<em>Who is generally looked upon as one of
the great martyrs of English liberty</em>,) was born 1641, and beheaded
1683, on the same charge of treason on which Algernon Sidney was
also condemned to suffer death.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span><span class='sc'>Earl of Caernarvon.</span>—The account of this speech is singular
enough. ‘Among the speakers on this occasion was the earl of
Caernarvon, who is said never to have spoken before; but having
been heated with wine, and rallied by the duke of Buckingham on
his never speaking, he said he would speak that very afternoon; and
this having produced some wager between them, he went into the
house with a resolution to speak on any subject that should offer
itself. He accordingly stood up, and delivered himself to the
following effect:’</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Anthony Ashley Cooper</span> was born at Winborn, in Dorsetshire,
in 1621, and died 1683. In 1640, he was chosen member
for Tewksbury. In 1672, he was created earl of Shaftesbury, and
appointed lord chancellor. This office he did not long retain, as he
was a man of fiery passions, turbulent, violent, and self-willed; and
was constantly opposing the schemes and measures of whatever party
he was connected with. He is the person described by Dryden
under the character of Achitophel. There is an instance recorded
of his great sagacity, which carries the <em>prophetic spirit</em> of common
sense as far as it can go. It is said that he had been to dine with
lady Clarendon and her daughter, who was at that time privately
married to the duke of York; and as he returned home with another
nobleman who had accompanied him, he suddenly turned to him,
and said, ‘Depend upon it, the duke has married Hyde’s daughter.’
His companion could not comprehend what he meant; but on
explaining himself, he said, ‘Her mother behaved to her with an
attention and a marked respect, that is impossible to account for in
any other way; and I am sure of it.’ This shortly afterwards
proved to be the case. The celebrated author of The Characteristics
was his grandson.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Henry Booth</span>, (<em>Lord Delamere</em>, <em>and afterwards created Earl of
Warrington</em>,) was member for Cheshire in the time of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> and
a great opposer of the court, and popery. He was committed to the
Tower for high-treason, by James <span class='fss'>II.</span> but was acquitted. He died
1694. There is a collection of his speeches in one volume, octavo.
That which I have given is not, perhaps, the best; but there is an
air of homely interest in it, a mixture of local and personal feeling,
which makes it the most amusing. The independent country gentleman,
the justice of the peace, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">custos rotulorum</span></i>, (to which latter
office he appears to have been as much attached as justice Shallow
himself could be,) his own personal disinterestedness, his political
zeal, and his great friendship for sir Thomas Manwaring, who seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>to have been a man of much importance in his time, though now
totally forgotten, are all brought together in a way that I like
exceedingly; and I can assure the reader, that if I do not present
him with a good collection, by following my own inclination in
taking those speeches which I like myself, and merely because I like
them, I should, however, make a much worse in any other way.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>John, Lord Somers</span>, was born 1652, and died 1710. He was
member for Worcester in the convention parliament, where he was
appointed to manage the conference with the lords, on the abdication
of king James, and in 1697 was made lord chancellor. He was one
of the principal persons employed in bringing about the revolution.
From this and the following speeches two things appear to me
tolerably clear, in opposition to the theories both of Mr. Burke and
Dr. Price on the subject; that the great constitutional leaders who
were concerned in producing this event, believed first, that the
hereditary right to the crown was not absolute, but conditional; or
that there was an original fundamental compact between the king and
people, the terms of which the former was bound to fulfil to make
good his title; secondly, that so long as these conditions were complied
with, the people were bound to maintain their allegiance to the
lawful successor, and not left at liberty to choose whom they pleased,
having no other law to govern them in their choice than their own
will, or fancy, or sense of convenience. There was indeed an estate
of inheritance, but then this was tied down and limited by certain
conditions, which, if not adhered to, the estate became lapsed and
forfeited. There was no question as the case stood, either of
sovereign absolute power, or of natural rights: the rights and duties
of both parties were defined and circumscribed by a constitution and
order of things already established, and which could not be infringed
on either side with impunity: that is, they were exactly in the state
of all contracting parties, neither of them independent, but each
having a check or control over the other: the one had no right to
enforce his claim if he did not perform what was <em>in the agreement</em>, and
the other party, so long as this was done, could not be <em>off their
bargain</em>. The king could not therefore be said to hold his crown
‘in contempt of the people,’ for both were equally responsible and
bound to one another, and both stood equally in awe of one another,
or of the <em>law</em>. But in case of any difference on this head, the right
to decide must of course belong to those who had the power; for by
the very nature of the thing there is nothing to restrain those who
have power in their hands from exercising it, but the sense of right
and wrong; and where they think they have a right to act, what is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>there to hinder them from acting in vindication of what they conceive
to be their right? I am not here entering into the abstract question
of government, nor do I pretend to say that this is the true law and
constitution of England; I am only stating what was understood to
be so by the prime movers and abettors of the revolution of 1688.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Daniel Finch</span>, (<em>Second Earl of Nottingham</em>,) was born 1647, and
died 1730. He was all his life an active politician, without being
devoted to any party. He seems to have gone just as far as his
principles would carry him, and no farther; and therefore often
stood still in his political career.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Robert Howard</span>, (<em>Who is known as a Political and Dramatic
Writer</em>,) was the son of the earl of Berkshire, knighted at the
restoration. He died about 1700.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>William III.</span> (<em>Prince of Orange</em>,) was born at the Hague in 1650.
He was the son of William, prince of Orange, and Henrietta,
daughter of king Charles <span class='fss'>I</span>. He married the daughter of James <span class='fss'>II.</span>;
and in consequence of the arbitrary conduct of that monarch, was
invited over in 1688, to take possession of the crown in his stead.
He died 1702, by a fall from his horse. He was a man of great
abilities, both as a statesman and general.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles Sedley</span>, (<em>One of the Wits and Poets of the Court of
Charles II.</em>,) was born about 1639, and died 1701. His daughter
had been mistress to James <span class='fss'>II.</span> who made her countess of Dorchester;
so that, on being asked why he was so great a favourer of the revolution,
he replied, ‘From a principle of gratitude: for since his
majesty has made my daughter a countess, it is fit I should do all I
can to make his daughter a queen.’</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir John Knight</span>, (<em>Member for Bristol</em>).—This worthy citizen,
(of whom I am sorry I can learn no more than his title, and the
place which he represented,) shall make his appearance, and at full
length, though he should be received with as dreadful a storm of
criticism, as that which he describes in the outset of his speech. He
is a true Englishman, a perfect islander. He seems to have as
thorough a hatred for the continent, and all its inhabitants, as if he
had been first swaddled in the leaky hold of a merchantman, or had
crawled out of the mud of the Bristol channel. He is not merely
warm, he perfectly <em>reeks</em> with patriotism, and antipathy to all
foreigners. For the last hundred years, we have only been working
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>on this model, and I do not see that we can get much beyond it.
We have, it is true, refined the stile, filled up the outlines, added
elegance to fury, and expanded our prejudices into systems of
philosophy. But we have added nothing to the stock. The design
and principles remain the same; and they are unalterable. The
pattern is closely copied from human nature. Indeed, I do not
know whether the best examples of modern declamation on this
subject, will be found to be much better than awkward affectation,
and laboured extravagance, in which the writers scarcely seem to
believe themselves, if we compare them with the spirit, the natural
expression, the force, and broad decided manner of this great master!</p>

<p class='c010'>For my own part, I confess I like the blunt, uncouth, <em>bear-garden</em>
stile; the coarse familiarity, and virulent abuse of this honest knight,
better than the studied elegance of modern invective. The stile is
suited to the subject. Every thing is natural and sincere, and warm
from the heart. Here are no fine-spun theories, no affected rancour,
no attempts to bind fast the spell of ignorance, by the calling in of
‘metaphysical aid,’ or to make use of the ice of philosophy as a
burning-glass to inflame the violence of the passions. Downright
passion, unconquerable prejudice, and unaffected enthusiasm, are
always justifiable; they follow a blind, but sure instinct; they flow
from a real cause; they are uniform and consistent with themselves;
and their mischiefs, whatever they are, have certain limits, may be
calculated upon, and provided against. But fine reasoning, and gross
feelings, do not accord well together. We may apply to them what
has been said of love, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non bene conveniunt, nec in una sede morantur
majestas et amor</span></i>. It is an unnatural union, which can produce nothing
but distortion. We are not at present hurried away by the honest
ebullitions of resentment, or blind zeal, but are in that state described
by Shakespeare, in which ‘reason panders will.’ No one is offended
at the ravings, the fierce gestures of a madman; but what should we
think of a man who affected to start, to foam at the mouth, and
feigned himself mad, only to have an opportunity for executing the
most mischievous purposes? We are not surprised to see poisonous
weeds growing in a wilderness; but who would think of transplanting
them into a cultivated garden? I am therefore glad to take refuge
from the mechanic, cold-blooded fury, and mercenary malice of
pretended patriotism, in the honest eloquence, ‘the downright violence
and storm of passion’ of this real enthusiast.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Lord Belhaven.</span> The following Speech is inserted in the debates
of this period. Though it does not come regularly within the plan
of this collection, yet I thought I might be allowed to give it for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>sake of diversifying the stile of the work, and as a curious record of
national feeling. As to the stile, ‘it has the melancholy madness
of poetry, without the inspiration.’ It has all the forms of eloquence,
but not all the power; and is an excellent instance to shew how far
mere <em>manner</em> will go. There can be little doubt but that this oration
must have produced a very great effect; and yet there is nothing in
it which any man might not say who was willing to indulge in the
same strain of academic description. But it adopts the language of
imagination, mimics her voice and gestures, conforms to her style by
a continued profusion of figure and personification, and is full of that
eloquence which consists in telling your mind freely, and which
carries the hearer along with it, because you never seem to doubt
for a moment of his sympathy, or that he does not take as great an
interest in the question as you do. There is no captious reserve, no
surly independence, no affected indifference, no fear of committing
yourself, or exposing yourself to ridicule by giving a loose to your
feelings; but every thing seems spoken with a full heart, sensible of
the value of the cause it espouses, and only fearful of failing in
expressions of zeal towards it, or in the respect that is due to it.
Perhaps, what I have here stated may serve to point out the
characteristic difference between the eloquence of the English and
the French. The latter avail themselves of all the advantages that
art and trick and adventitious ornament can give; and they are
chiefly anxious to produce an effect by the most obvious means.
If their thoughts are but fine, they do not care how common they
are: this is because they have more vanity than pride, and are
willing to be pleased at any rate. On the other hand, an Englishman’s
muse is generally the spleen. He is for defying others into
sympathy, and had rather incur their contempt than endeavour to
gain their good opinion by shewing a desire to please them. He
likes to do every thing in the most difficult way, and from a spirit
of contradiction. Accordingly, his eloquence (when it is forced
from him) is the best that can be, because it is of nature’s doing,
and not his own, and comes from him in spite of himself. However,
there is a sort of gallantry in eloquence as well as in love. To coquet
with the muses, to dally with the fair forms of speech, to be full of
nothing but apostrophes, interjections, interrogations, to be in raptures
at the sight of a capital letter, and to take care never to lose a fine
thought any more than a fine girl, for fear of putting a question, are
the only means by which a man without imagination can hope to be
an orator; as it is only by being a coxcomb, that a man who is not
handsome can ever think of pleasing the women! But to return
from this digression to the speech itself, it contains a good deal of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>warmth and animation, and if the author had been a young man, would
have done him credit.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>George I.</span> was the son of the Elector of Hanover, by Sophia,
grand-daughter of James <span class='fss'>I</span>. He was born in 1660, and succeeded
queen Anne, in 1714. He died suddenly, abroad, in 1727. He
talks of the throne of his ancestors with a pious simplicity.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Robert Harley</span>, (<em>Eldest Son of Sir Edward Harley</em>, <em>and afterwards
Earl of Oxford</em>,) was born 1661, and died 1724. His
politics in the latter part of the reign of queen Anne, rendered him
obnoxious in the succeeding reign; and in 1715, he was accused of
high-treason, but was at length acquitted. He was the friend of
Swift.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Thomas Hanmer</span>, (<em>Member for Suffolk</em>,) was born in 1676;
he was chosen speaker of the house of commons in 1713, and died
in 1746. He published an edition of Shakespeare. He was a very
respectable speaker. The following address contains a sort of
summary of the politics of the day, and gathers up the ‘threads
of shrewd and politic design’ that were snapped short at the end of
the preceding reign.</p>

<p class='c010'>If this speech does not contain good sound English sense, I do not
know where we shall look for it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Richard Steele</span> was born at Dublin, though the year in
which he was born is not known, and died in 1729. He was
member for Boroughbridge in Yorkshire. I have made the following
extract less for the sake of the speech than the speaker; for I
could not pass by the name of an author to whom we owe two of the
most delightful books that ever were written, the Spectator and
Tatler. As a party man he was a most furious Whig.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr.</span> (afterwards <span class='sc'>Sir</span>) <span class='sc'>Robert Walpole</span> was born at Houghton,
in Norfolk, in 1674, and died 1745. In 1700, he was chosen
member of parliament for Lynn. In 1705, he was appointed
secretary at war; and in 1709, treasurer of the navy; but, on the
change of ministers, he was voted guilty of corruption, and expelled
the house. The whig party strenuously supported him; and he was
re-elected for Lynn, though the election was declared void. At the
accession of George <span class='fss'>I.</span> he was made paymaster of the forces; but
two years after he resigned, and joined the opposition. Another
change taking place in 1725, he took the lead in administration,
being chosen first lord of the treasury, and chancellor of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>exchequer. He maintained himself in this situation till 1742, when
he resigned, and was created earl of Oxford, with a pension of
4,000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> a year.</p>

<p class='c010'>We may form as good an idea of the talents of this celebrated man
as a speaker in the house of commons, from the following speech
as from any that he has left behind him. He may be considered
as the first who (if the similitude be not too low to be admitted,
I confess nothing can be lower) threw the house of commons
into the form of a regular debating society. In his time debate
was organized; all the common-place topics of political controversy
were familiar in the mouths of both parties. The combatants on
each side, in this political warfare, were regularly drawn up in
opposition to each other, and had their several parts assigned them
with the greatest exactitude.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The popular harangue, the tart reply,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘The logic, and the wisdom, and the wit,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>appeared in all their combined lustre. The effect of this
system could not be different from what it has turned out.
The house of commons, instead of being the representative and
depository of the collective sense of the nation, has become a theatre
for wrangling disputants to declaim in the scene of noisy impertinence
and pedantic folly. An empty shew of reason, a set of words
has been substituted for the silent operation of general feeling and
good sense; and ministers referring every thing to this flimsy
standard have been no longer taken up in planning wise measures,
but in studying how to defend their blunders. It has been usual
to draw a sort of parallel between the person of whom we are
speaking, and the late Mr. Pitt. For this perhaps there is little
more foundation than the great length of their administrations, and
their general ability as leaders of the debates in parliament. If I
were disposed to make a comparison of this kind, I should attempt
to describe them by their differences rather than their resemblances.
They had both perhaps equal plausibility, equal facility,
and equal presence of mind; but it was of an entirely different
kind, and arose from different causes in each of them.
Walpole’s manner was more natural and less artificial; his
resources were more the result of spontaneous vigour and quickness
of mind, and less the growth of cultivation and industry.
If the late minister was superior to his predecessor in office in
logical precision, in the comprehensive arrangement of his subject,
and a perfect acquaintance with the topics of common-place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>declamation, he was certainly at the same time very much his
inferior in acuteness of understanding, in original observation,
and knowledge of human nature, and in lively, unexpected turns
of thought. Pitt’s readiness was not owing to the quickness
or elasticity of his understanding, but to a perfect self-command,
a steadiness and inflexibility of mind, which never lost sight
of the knowledge which it had in its possession, nor was ever distracted
in the use of it. Nothing ever assumed a new shape in passing
through his mind: he recalled his ideas just as they were originally
impressed, and they neither received nor ever threw a sparkling
light on any subject with which he connected them, either by
felicity of combination, or ingenuity of argument. They were of
that loose, general, unconnected kind, as just to fill the places they
were brought out to occupy in the rank and file of an oration,
and then returned mechanically back to their several stations, to
be ready to appear again whenever they were called for. Walpole’s
eloquence, on the other hand, was less an affair of reminiscence,
and more owing to present invention. He seems to have spoken
constantly on the spur of the occasion; without pretending to
exhaust his subject, he often put it in a striking point of view; and
the arguments into which he was led in following the doublings
and windings of a question, were such as do not appear
to have occurred to himself before nor to have been made use
of by others. When he had to obviate any objection, he did
not do it so much by ambiguity or evasion, as by immediately
starting some other difficulty on the opposite side of the question,
which blunted the edge of the former, and staggered the
opinion of his hearers. The stile of their speeches is also marked
by the same differences as their mode of reasoning. In the one
you discover the ease and vivacity of the gentleman, of the man of
the world; in the other the studied correctness of the scholar.
The one has the variety, simplicity, and smartness of conversation;
the other has all the fulness, the pomp, the premeditated involutions
and measured periods of a book, but of a book not written
in the best stile. The one is more agreeable and insinuating; the
other more imposing and majestic. Not to spin out this comparison
to an unnecessary length I should think that Walpole was less completely
armed for entering the lists with his antagonists, but that
his weapons were keener, and more difficult to manage; that Pitt
had more art, and Walpole more strength and activity; that
the display of controversial dexterity was in Walpole more a trial of
wit, and in Pitt more an affair of science; that Walpole had more
imagination, and Pitt more understanding; if, indeed, any thing can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>entitle a man to the praise of understanding, which is neither
valuable, nor his own.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Francis Atterbury</span>, (<em>Bishop of Rochester</em>,) was born in 1662.
His eloquence brought him early into notice. His political principles
were very violent, and engaged him in several controversies. He
assisted Dr. Sacheverel in drawing up his defence. When the
rebellion broke out in 1715, he and bishop Smalridge refused to
sign the Declaration of the bishops; and in 1722 he was apprehended
and committed to the Tower, on suspicion of being concerned
in some plot to bring in the Pretender. He was sentenced to be
banished for life, and left the kingdom in 1723. He died at Paris
in 1732. He is now chiefly remembered as an elegant writer, and
as the intimate friend of Pope and Swift. The following is the
conclusion of his defence before the house of lords.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Allen</span> (afterwards <span class='sc'>Lord</span>) <span class='sc'>Bathurst</span>, (<em>The Son of Sir Benjamin
Bathurst</em>,) was born in 1684, and educated at Oxford. In 1705
he was chosen member for Cirencester in Gloucestershire. He
joined the tory party, and was one of the opposers of Walpole’s
administration. He was created a peer in 1711. He died in 1775,
aged 91. He lived on terms of the greatest intimacy with Swift,
Pope, and other literary men. He was one of the ablest speakers
of the house of lords; and I think, that at the time when most
of his speeches were made, the house of lords contained more
excellent speakers, and divided the palm of eloquence more equally
with the house of commons, than at any other period. One reason
why it is morally impossible that the house of peers should ever
be able to rival the house of commons in the display of splendid
talents, is, that all questions of importance are first debated in the
house of commons. Even if the members of the upper house had
any thing of their own to say, the words are fairly taken out of
their mouths.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Philip, Duke of Wharton</span>, was born about 1699. He first
attached himself to the Pretender, when he was abroad and quite a
young man. He then returned home and made his peace with
government. After this he became a violent oppositionist; and
having at length reduced his fortune by his extravagance, he went
abroad again, where he once more attached himself to the Pretender,
and died 1731. He is represented as a man of talents by Pope, who
has given him a niche in one of his satires.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. Shippen</span> was member for Saltash. He was one of the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>vehement and vigorous opposers of the measures of government
through the whole of this reign; and, no doubt, had imbibed a very
strong tincture of Jacobitism. But he was a man of great firmness
and independence of mind, a manly, vigorous, and correct speaker;
and whatever his personal motives or sentiments might have been,
the principles which he uniformly avowed and maintained, were
sound and constitutional.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir W. Wyndham</span>, (<em>Member for Somersetshire</em>,) was born 1687.
In 1710 he was made secretary at war, and in 1713 chancellor of
the exchequer. He was dismissed from his place on the accession
of George <span class='fss'>I.</span> and being suspected of having a concern in the rebellion
in 1715, was committed to the Tower, but liberated without being
brought to a trial. He died 1740. It was to him that Lord
Bolingbroke addressed that celebrated letter in defence of himself,
which is the best of all his works.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Earl of Strafford.</span> I can find no particular account of the
author of this speech, though I suppose he was a descendant of
the great lord Strafford. A noble line seldom furnishes more than
one great name. The succeeding branches seldom add any thing to
the illustriousness of the stock, and are so far from keeping up the
name, that they are lost in it. However I do not discover any
marks of degeneracy in the present instance: one may trace a sort
of family likeness in the sentiments; the pedigree of the mind seems
to have been well kept up. There is a nobility of soul as well as
of blood; and the feelings of humanity so closely and beautifully
expressed in the conclusion of this speech, are such as we should
expect from the cultivated descendant of ‘a man of honour and a
cavalier.’</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Horace Walpole</span>, (<em>Brother to Sir Robert</em>,) was member for
Yarmouth. He seems to have been little inferior to the minister
in facility of speaking, and a certain ambidexterity of political logic.
He had the art to make the question assume at will whatever shape
he pleased, and to make ‘the worse appear the better reason.’ But
this seems to have been more a trick, or an habitual readiness in the
common-place forms of trivial argument, and less owing to natural
capacity and quickness of mind, than it was in his brother. There
is also less ease and more slovenliness, less grace and more of the
affectation of it, than are to be found in his brother’s speeches.
He appears more desirous of shewing his art than of concealing it,
and to be proud of the trappings of ministerial authority which excite
the spleen and envy of his opponents.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span><span class='sc'>William Pulteney</span>, (<em>afterwards Earl of Bath</em>,) was born 1682,
and died 1764. He was the bitterest opponent Sir Robert Walpole
ever had, (which is said to have arisen from some difference between
them at the outset of their political career) and he at length succeeded
in driving him from his situation. He was member for Heydon, in
Yorkshire. He lost all the popularity he had gained by his long
opposition to the ministerial party, when he was made a peer, and
sunk into obscurity and contempt. I think the following is the best of
his speeches. He was, however, in general, a very able speaker.
The stile of his speeches is particularly good, and exactly fitted to
produce an effect on a mixed audience. His sentences are short,
direct, pointed; yet full and explicit, abounding in repetitions of the
same leading phrase or idea, whenever this had a tendency to rivet
the impression more strongly in the mind of the hearer, or to prevent
the slightest obscurity or doubt. He also knew perfectly well how
to avail himself of the resources contained in the stately significance,
and gross familiarity of the dialect of the house of commons. To
talk in the character of a great parliamentary leader, to assume the
sense of the house, to affect the extensive views and disinterested
feelings that belong to a great permanent body, and to descend in
a moment to all the pertness and scurrility, the conceit and self-importance
of a factious bully, are among the great arts of parliamentary
speaking. Dogmatical assumptions, consequential airs, and big words,
are what convince and overawe the generality of hearers, who always
judge of others by their pretensions, and feel the greatest confidence
in those who have the least doubt about themselves. There is also
in this gentleman’s speeches, a character, which indeed they had in
common with most of the speeches of the time; that is, they discover
a general knowledge of the affairs of Europe, and of the intrigues,
interests, and engagements of the different courts on the continent;
they shew the statesman, and the man of business, as well as the
orator. These minute details render the speeches of this period long
and uninteresting, which prevented me from giving so many of them
as the ability displayed in them would otherwise have required. This
diplomatic eloquence seems to have been gaining ground from the
time of the revolution. We may see from Lord Bolingbroke’s writings
how much the study of such subjects was in fashion in his time.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Gilbert Heathcote</span> was an alderman of London. He spoke
frequently in the house about this period, and always in a plain,
sensible manner.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>John Lord Carteret</span>, (<em>afterwards Earl of Granville</em>,) succeeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>his father George lord Carteret when very young. He was educated
at Oxford, and took his seat in the house of lords in 1711, where he
distinguished himself by his zeal for the Hanover succession. In
1719, he went ambassador to Sweden, and in 1724, was appointed
viceroy of Ireland, where his administration, at a very trying period,
was generally applauded for its wisdom and moderation. He died
in 1763. He was a man of abilities, an highly amiable character,
and a great encourager of learned men. To him it was that the
celebrated Hutcheson dedicated his elegant treatise on beauty and
virtue.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. Campbell</span>, (<em>Member for Pembrokeshire</em>).—He seems in this
debate to have steered clear of any thing like common sense, with
such dexterity, that it would be no difficult matter to pronounce him
more knave than fool. A man cannot be so ingeniously in the wrong
by accident. There is a striking resemblance between the arguments
here used, and some that have been brought forward on more recent
occasions. Change the form, the names, and the date, and in reading
this, and the following speech, you would suppose yourself to be
reading the contents of a modern newspaper. It is astonishing how
trite, how thread-bare this subject of politics is worn; how completely
every topic relating to it is exhausted; how little is left for the
invention of low cunning to plume itself upon, or for honest ambition
to boast of! Those who have it in their power may very wisely
devote themselves to politics, either to serve their own ends, or to
serve the public; but it is too late to think of acquiring distinction in
this way. A man can at present only be a retail dealer in politics:
he can only keep a sort of huckster’s shop of ready made goods. Do
what he can, he can only repeat what has already been said a thousand
times, and make a vain display of borrowed wisdom or folly. “’Twas
mine, ’tis his, and may be any man’s.” What gratification there can
be in this to any one, who does not live entirely in the echo of his
own name, I do not understand. I should as soon think of being
proud of wearing a suit of second hand clothes, or marrying another
man’s cast-off mistress. In the beaten path of vulgar ambition, the
dull, the mechanical, the superficial, and the forward press on, and
are successful, while the man of genius, ashamed of his competitors,
shrinks from the contest and is soon lost in the crowd.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Samuel Sandys</span>, (<em>Member for Worcester</em>,) was one of the most
frequent and able speakers of this period. What his principles were
I do not know: for the side which any person took at this time, was
a very equivocal test of his real sentiments; toryism, through this and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>the preceding reign, generally assuming the shape of resistance to the
encroachments of the prerogative, and attachment to the liberties of
the people.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Philip Dormer Stanhope</span>, (<em>Earl of Chesterfield</em>,) was born in
1694. He was educated at Cambridge, after which he went abroad,
and on his return to England, became a member of the house of
commons. In 1726 he succeeded his father in the house of peers.
He was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1745, where he continued
till 1748. He died 1773. I have given a greater number of
his speeches than of any person’s about this time, because I found
them more ingenious, and amusing, and elegant, than any others.
They are steeped in classical allusion; and he seems always anxious
to adjust the dress, and regulate the forms of the English constitution,
by the looking-glass of the Roman commonwealth. There may be
a little sprinkling of academic affectation in this, but it is much more
agreeable than the diplomatic impertinence and official dulness, which
were at that time so much in vogue. His speeches are, in this respect,
a striking contrast to those of Pulteney, Pitt, Pelham, &amp;c. It has been
said that they want force and dignity. If it be meant that they are
not pompous and extravagant, I shall admit the truth of the objection.
But I cannot see why ease is inconsistent with vigour, or that it is a
sign of wisdom to be dull. If his speeches contain as much good
sense, and acute discrimination as those of his rivals, as clearly
expressed, and seasoned with more liveliness of fancy, I should be
disposed to listen to them more attentively, or to read them oftener,
than if, as is often the case, their strength consisted in mere violence
and turbulence, and their only pretensions to wisdom arose from
their want of wit. There is something very peculiar in the form
of his sentences. He perpetually takes up the former part of a
sentence, and by throwing it into the next clause, gives a distinctness
and pointedness to every separate branch of it. His sentences look
like a succession of little smart climaxes. ‘And, therefore, an administration
without esteem—without authority among the people, let
their power be never so great—let their power be never so arbitrary,
will be ridiculed. The severest edicts—the most terrible punishments,
cannot prevent it. If any man, therefore, thinks that he has
been censured—if any man thinks he has been ridiculed, upon any of
our public theatres,’ &amp;c. ‘As no man is perfect, as no man is
infallible,’ &amp;c. See his speech on the theatres. This method, is,
I suspect, borrowed from the French: where it suits with the turn
of a man’s mind, it is agreeable enough, and must have a very good
effect in speaking. It is, at least, better than our modern style of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>rhetorical architecture, where the nominative case is mounted up at
the top of the page, and the verb fixed at the bottom; than those
circular ladders, and winding-staircases in language, where the whole
hangs suspended in an airy round, and the meaning drops down
through the middle. The late Mr. Pitt was a master of this involved
style.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir John St. Aubin</span>, (<em>Member for Cornwall</em>,) was one of that
phalanx of ability and energy, that regularly withstood the insidious
encroachments, and undermining influence of Walpole’s administration.
Their motives for this were no doubt various; but the knowledge,
the soundness of understanding, the firmness and perseverance displayed
in pursuit of their object, cannot be too much admired, and
have never been surpassed. The great questions which had occupied
men’s minds from the time of the revolution, and which still continued
to agitate them as much as ever, the interest in them being kept alive
by the doubtful issue of the contest, had given them a manly tone, a
solidity and fervour which could hardly be produced in any other
circumstances. I may say that men’s minds were never so truly
English as they were at this period. Even the leaven of Jacobitism,
which was mingled up with the sentiments of many of the party, must
have contributed to add a zest, a poignancy, a bitterness of indignation
to their opposition to that overbearing influence, and despotic sway,
for the undue exercise of which they had seen a family, to which they
were strongly attached, driven from the throne. The principles of
liberty assented to by both parties, also gave a freedom and animation
to the debates of this period, and an advantage in attacking any unconstitutional
or unpopular measure, which nothing but the great
abilities of the minister, aided by the general confidence in the
government, could have resisted so long as they did. The following
speech of Sir J. St. Aubin, has been often referred to, and it is one of
the most elegant and able compositions to be found in the records of
the house of commons.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Watkin Williams Wynne</span> was member for Denbighshire. It
cannot be denied that the following speech is a real and close
examination of the question.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr.</span> (afterwards <span class='sc'>Sir</span>) <span class='sc'>John Barnard</span> was originally a merchant,
and was chosen to represent the city of London in parliament, in
consequence of the abilities he displayed on being appointed by the
body of wine merchants to state before the house of lords their
objections to a bill then pending. He continued to represent the city
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>forty years, and so much to the satisfaction of his constituents, that
they erected a statue to him in the exchange. He was knighted by
George <span class='fss'>II.</span> He was born 1685, and died 1764.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>George</span> (<span class='sc'>Lord</span>) <span class='sc'>Lyttleton</span>, (<em>The eldest son of Sir T. Lyttleton</em>,)
was born 1709, and died 1773. He distinguished himself both as a
speaker and a writer. He appears (as far as I can understand,) to
have been one of those men, who gain a high reputation, not so
much by deserving, as by desiring it; who are constantly going
out of their way in search of fame, and therefore can scarcely
miss it; who are led to seize on the shewy and superficial parts of
science by an instinct of vanity, as the surest means of attracting
vulgar applause; who by aiming at what is beyond them, do at
least all that they are capable of; whose anxiety to distinguish
themselves from others, serves them in the place of genius; and
who obtain the good opinion of the public merely by shewing their
deference to it. This character, it must be confessed, however, is
generally united with sensibility and an elegant turn of mind, and
is therefore entitled to some credit: for next to the possession of
real excellence, I think we ought to respect the admiration of it,
and the wish to possess it, or whatever in our power comes the
nearest to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>I must confess that the following Speech on abolishing certain
feudal jurisdictions in Scotland is one of the most elegant and
ingenious in this collection.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>William Pitt</span>, (<em>afterwards Earl of Chatham</em>,) was born at
Boconnock, in Cornwall, in 1708, and died in 1778. He was
originally an officer in the army, but was chosen member for
Old Sarum in 1735. His history is too well-known to need
repeating here. I shall say something of his talents as a speaker
hereafter.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Philip Yorke</span>, (<em>afterwards Earl of Hardwicke</em>,) was born 1690,
died 1764. He was brought into parliament for Lewes in Sussex in
1718. In 1736, he was made lord chancellor, which situation he
held for twenty years. He is said to have been a great lawyer. If
so, a great lawyer may be a very little man. There is in his speech
a <em>petiteness</em>, an insignificant subtlety, an affected originality, a trifling
formality, which any one, not accustomed to the laborious fooleries
and idle distinctions of the law, would be ashamed of. All those of
his speeches that I have read are in the same minute stile of special-pleading,
accompanied with the same apologies for the surprize which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>must be occasioned by his microscopical discoveries and methodical
singularities.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>John Campbell</span>, (<em>Second Duke of Argyle</em>,) was born 1671, and
entered young into the army. He served under the duke of Marlborough:
he also distinguished himself as a statesman, and was an
active promoter of the union, for which he incurred great odium
among his own countrymen. In 1712, he was appointed commander
in chief in Scotland, and in 1715, he routed the earl of Mar’s army
at Dumblain, and forced the pretender to quit the kingdom. Notwithstanding
his eminent services to the state, he was deprived of
several high offices which he held, for his opposition to Sir Robert
Walpole. He died in 1743. There is a noble monument erected
to his memory in Westminster Abbey. His speeches are characterized
by a rough, plain, manly spirit of good sense, and a zealous
attachment to the welfare of his country.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Honourable Edward Coke.</span>—The following speech contains
some reflections that are not inapplicable to the present times.
It is curious to observe how exact a picture the author has
exhibited of the present state of Europe, how literally his fears
have been verified, and yet how utterly unfounded and chimerical
they were at the time. One might be tempted to suppose, in
reading the dreams of these forward and self-pleasing prognosticators,
that the scheme of universal empire, with which the rulers of
France have been so often complimented, had familiarized her
imagination to the design, and engendered those high thoughts of
ambition and vanity which have at length rendered her power, not a
glittering phantom, an idle bugbear, a handle for crooked policy, for
low manœuvres, and petty, vexatious, endless hostility, the plaything
of orators and statesmen, but a tremendous and overwhelming reality,
that like a vast incubus overlays the continent of Europe, and benumbs
its lethargic energies.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir Dudley Ryder.</span>—To those who have to wade through the
crude, undigested mass of the records of parliament, there is such a
tedious monotony, such a dreary vacuity of thought, such an eternal
self-complacent repetition of the same worn-out topics, which seem to
descend like an inheritance from one generation to another, that it is
some relief to escape now and then from the dull jargon of political
controversy. I have given the following speech, though it is sufficiently
dry and uninteresting in itself, because it a little varies the prospect,
and contains something that looks like ingenuity and argument.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span><span class='sc'>Henry Fox, Esq.</span>, (<em>afterwards Lord Holland</em>,) was the father of
the late celebrated C. J. Fox. Perhaps the reader may be able to
trace some resemblance in their manner of speaking; the same close
consecutive mode of reasoning, and the same disposition to <em>go round</em>
his subject, and view it in its various aspects and bearings.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. Grenville.</span>—The following is a neat, clear, logical, and I think
masterly speech on the subject. Nothing could be put in a more
simple or forcible manner.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>William Murray</span>, (<em>Earl of Mansfield</em>,) was the fourth son of the
earl of Stormont, and born at Perth in 1705. He was educated at
Westminster school, and afterwards at Oxford, where he took his
degrees. On being called to the bar, his eloquence gained him many
admirers; and he was called by Pope ‘the silver-tongued Murray.’
In 1742, he became solicitor-general, and was elected member of
parliament. In 1754, he was made attorney-general, and in 1756,
chief justice of the king’s bench, soon after which he was created
baron Mansfield. He resigned his office in 1788, owing to his
infirmities, and died in 1793. The reputation which he acquired,
both as a lawyer and a speaker, was not unmerited. I believe his
character has been in all respects as justly appreciated as that of most
men. He was undoubtedly a man of great abilities and great acquirements;
but he was neither a very great nor a very honest man.
He was a man of nice perceptions, of an acute and logical understanding,
of a clear and comprehensive mind, as far as the habits of his
profession and his pursuits in life would suffer him to be so. Indeed
it is difficult to say, what are the capacities of a man of this character,
whose views are cramped and confined by the servility of office; who
adjusts the dimensions of his understanding according to the size of
the occasion; whose reason is constantly the puppet of his will;
whose powers expand in the gleam of popularity, or shrink and shrivel
up at the touch of power. There was a natural antipathy between
his mind and lord Chatham’s. The one was ardent and impetuous:
the other was cool, circumspect, wary, delighting in difficulties and
subtlety, proud rather of distrusting its natural feelings and detecting
errors in them, than impatient of any thing that thwarted their course,
and exerting all its powers to prove them to be right. The manner
in which lord Chatham always spoke of Mansfield was the most
pointed that could be: Junius did not treat him with more sarcastic
bitterness and contempt. Indeed there is a striking coincidence
between the opinions and sentiments of that celebrated writer, and
those of lord Chatham, in many respects. They had the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>political creed and the same personal prejudices. Chatham had not
only the same marked dislike to lord Mansfield, but he had evidently
the same personal dislike to the king, always directing his censures
not so much against his measures, as the man; always tracing them
beyond his ministers to the throne itself, and connecting them with a
deliberate plan to overturn the balance of the constitution, and undermine
the liberties of the people. He has expressed the same unpopular
opinion respecting the impressing of seamen that Junius has done;
which is rather singular in two men professing so strong an attachment
to the liberty of the subject, and who so generally appealed to popular
feelings. It is to be remembered, also, that Junius speaks of certain
mysterious arrangements, and expresses himself concerning certain
characters, in a tone of confidence and with a degree of asperity which
could hardly be expected in any one who was not personally acquainted
with the secrets of the cabinet. As to the differences of stile between
Junius’s letters and lord Chatham’s speeches, though they are very
great, I do not think they are so great but that they may be accounted
for from the mere difference between writing and speaking. The
materials themselves are not essentially different: the difference is in
the manner of working them up. There is none of that pointed
neatness, that brilliant contrast, that artificial modulation, and elaborate
complexity in the style of lord Chatham’s speeches that there is in
Junius; and there is a flow, a rapidity, a vehemence and ardour in
them, that is totally wanting in Junius. At the same time, I can
easily conceive that a man like lord Chatham, who has gained the
highest reputation as an orator, and was satisfied with the proofs he
had given of the force and solidity of his mind, should take a pride
in exciting the admiration of the public by the neatness and elegance
of his compositions, by adding delicacy to strength, by the minute
refinements and graceful ornaments of style: as your bold, dashing
designers have generally (to shew the versatility of their talents)
executed their small cabinet pieces in a style of the most highly
finished correctness. On the other hand, it is not at all likely that
lord Chatham, even supposing him to have been master of all the
subtlety and exactness of Junius, would have spoken in any other
manner than he did. It would have been nearly impossible to speak
as Junius writes; and besides, he was a man of too much sense to
forego the advantages which his person, voice, and manner afforded
him in that impressive, simple, manly style which he adopted, and
which they could not have afforded him equally in any other, for the
reputation of an elegant speaker. As to the character which Junius
gives of lord Chatham, it is just such a character as a man would give
of himself. Both his silence and his praise are suspicious. Though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>I do not, on the whole, think it probable that lord Chatham was the
author of Junius, yet I think that he was by far the most likely person
that has been named. He was about equal to the task. He had the
same pith and nerve, the same acuteness and vigour: he worked in
the same metal as Junius, with a little less sharpness and fineness in
the execution, and more boldness in the design. Burke was above it,
Dunning was below it. It was physically impossible that Burke
should have been the author. He could no more have written
Junius, from the exuberance and originality of his mind, than Dunning
could have written it, from the poverty of his. The speeches of the
latter are ‘as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage.’ No human
art could have moulded his stiff set meagre sentences, with all the
technical formality and servile exactness of a legal document, into the
harmonious combinations and graceful inflections of Junius’s style. It
is most likely that it will never be known who Junius really was, and
I do not wish it ever should; it is a sort of singular phenomenon,
and curious riddle in the history of literature. It is better that it
should remain a secret, and be something to wonder at, than that by
it’s being explained, every one should become perfectly satisfied and
perfectly indifferent about it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Charles Pratt</span>, (<em>Earl Camden</em>,) was the son of Sir John Pratt,
and born in the year 1713. He was educated at Cambridge. He
made little figure for many years after he was called to the bar; but
at length, by the interest of the chancellor Henley, he obtained
considerable practice, and was recommended by him to the friendship
of Mr. Pitt, afterwards lord Chatham. By this means, he successively
rose to the stations of attorney-general, chief justice of the common
pleas, and lord chancellor. He distinguished himself in the latter
situations by taking a decided part against the government, in favour
of Wilkes. For this, he had the freedom of the city of London
voted him in a gold box, and his portrait was stuck up in Guildhall.
He was made president of the council after the American war, which
situation he held till his death, in 1794. He appears to have been a
mere party man, without any abilities whatever, and without that
sense of his own deficiencies which atones for the want of them. He
was the legal mouth-piece of Chatham, the judicial oracle of the party,
who gravely returned the answers that were given him by the political
priesthood, of whom he was the organ. He was one of those dull,
plodding, headstrong, honest men, with whom so large a part of the
community naturally sympathise, and of whom it is always convenient
to have one at least in every administration, or antiministerial
party. To the generality of mankind, dulness is the natural object of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>sympathy and admiration; it is the element in which they breathe;
it is that which is best fitted to their gross capacities. The divinity
of genius is itself too dazzling an object for them to behold, and
requires the friendly interposition of some thick cloud to dim its
lustre, and blunt the fierceness of its rays. The people love to
idolize greatness in some vulgar representation of it, and to worship
their own likeness in stocks and stones. Lord Camden was just the
man to address those who can only assent, but cannot reason. With
men of this character, the strength of the reasoning always weakens
the force of the argument; their heads will only bear a certain
quantity of thought, and by attempting to enlighten, you only confound
their understandings. Any thing like proof always operates as
a negative quantity upon their prejudices, because it puts them out of
their way, and they cannot get into any other. Nothing can be more
feeble than the following reply of his to lord Mansfield, in which he
had pledged himself to prove—I know not what. He was more
ready to throw down his pledges than to redeem them, (to speak in
the parliamentary style). This was of little consequence. Though
often foiled, it did not abate his ardour, or lessen his confidence: he
was still <em>staunch</em> to his cause, and (no matter whether right or wrong
in his argument,) he was always sure of his conclusion. The less
success a man has in maintaining his point, the more does he shew his
steadiness and attachment to his object in persevering in it in spite of
opposition; and the proof of fortitude which he thus gives must
naturally induce all those of the same sanguine disposition, who have
the same zeal and the same imbecility in the defence of truth, to make
common cause with him. Such was lord Camden; of whom, however,
(lest I should seem to have conceived some hasty prejudice
against him,) I must confess that I am by no means convinced that
he was not quite as great a man as the generality of those who have
risen by the same gradations to the same high offices that he did,
either before or since his time.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Colonel Barre.</span>—He was one of the most strenuous opposers of
lord North’s administration. Junius says, ‘I would borrow a simile
from Burke, or a sarcasm from Barre.’ There is a vein of shrewd
irony, a lively, familiar, conversational pleasantry running through all
his speeches. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Garrit aniles ex re fabellas.</span></i> His eloquence is certainly
the most <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïve</span></i>, the most unpremeditated, the most gay and heedless,
that can be imagined. He was really and naturally what Courteney
(afterwards) only pretended to be. [Hazlitt adds in a note]—I am
sorry that I can give no account of this celebrated character. Indeed,
I have to apologize to the reader for the frequent defects and chasms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>in the biographical part of the work. I have looked carefully into
the dictionaries, but unless a man happens to have been a nonconformist
divine in the last century, a chymist, or the maker of a
new spelling and pronouncing dictionary, his name is hardly sure of
obtaining a place in these learned compilations. The writers seem,
by a natural sympathy, more anxious to bring obscure merit into
notice, than to gratify the idle curiosity of the public respecting
characters on which a dazzling splendor has been shed, by the
accidental circumstances of situation, by superficial accomplishments,
and shewy talents. In giving the history of illustrious statesmen or
politicians, they are very uncertain helps; but if any one had to make
out a list of antiquarians, schoolmasters, or conjurors, he would find
them complete for his purpose. The Barres, the Grenvilles, and the
Townshends, are forgotten; while the Dyches, the Fennings, the
Lillys, and the Laxtons, vie with the heroes and sages of antiquity,
in these motley lists of fame, which like death, level all ranks, and
confound all distinctions.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Frederick, Lord North</span>, (<em>afterwards Earl of Guildford</em>,) was born
in 1732. He succeeded Mr. C. Townshend as chancellor of the
exchequer, and in 1770 was made first lord of the treasury, in which
situation he continued till the close of the American war. He died
in 1792. His speeches are in general, like the following, short,
shrewd, and lively, and quite free from the affectation of oratory.
He spoke like a gentleman, like a man of sense and business, who
had to explain himself on certain points of moment to the country,
and who in doing this did not think that his first object was to shew
how well he could play the orator by the hour. The following
masterly character is given of him by Burke. ‘He was a man of
admirable parts; of a general knowledge; of versatile understanding
fitted for every sort of business; of infinite wit and pleasantry;
of a delightful temper; and with a mind most perfectly disinterested.
But it would be only to degrade myself by a weak adulation, and not
to honour the memory of a great man, to deny that he wanted
something of the vigilance and spirit of command that the time
required.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The following Speech is a most masterly defence of himself. It is
a model in its kind.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. Burke</span> was born at Dublin, January 1, 1730. His father
was a respectable attorney, and a Protestant. He received his school
education under Abraham Shackleton, a Quaker; and whenever Mr.
Burke afterwards visited Ireland, he always went to see his old tutor.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>In 1746, he entered as a scholar at Trinity College, which he left,
after taking his bachelor’s degree, in 1749. Not long after, he
became candidate for the professorship of logic, at Glasgow, but did
not succeed. In 1753, he entered himself of the Inner Temple, but
he did not apply very closely to the study of the law, and supported
himself by writing for the booksellers. In 1756, he published his
Vindication of Natural Society, and in 1757 his Essay on the
Sublime and Beautiful. He was first brought into parliament for the
borough of Wendover, by the interest of lord Rockingham, to whom
he had been private secretary. He soon after published his Thoughts
on the Causes of the Present Discontents. In 1774, he was invited
by the citizens of Bristol to become one of their representatives; but
at the next election, he was rejected by them, for having supported
the free trade of Ireland and the Catholic claims, and was returned
for Malton, in Yorkshire. The rest of his political life is too well
known to need recapitulating here. The part he took against the
French revolution was the most important and memorable event of
his life. He withdrew from parliament in 1794, leaving his seat for
Malton to his son, who died shortly after. This hastened his death,
which happened in July, 1797. The best character of him, and
perhaps the finest that ever was drawn of any man, is that by
Goldsmith, in his poem of Retaliation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The Honourable C. J. Fox</span> was born Jan. 13, 1748. He was
educated first at Eton and afterwards at Hertford College, Oxford.
He was returned to Parliament for Midhurst in 1768. He was at
first on the side of ministry, but declared himself on the side of
opposition on the dispute with America. He became secretary for
foreign affairs in 1782, and again in 1806, when it was too late for
his country and himself. He died September, 1806. Of this great
man I shall speak more at large when I come to his later speeches.
The following boyish rhapsody, on a question relating to the Lowther
estate, is remarkable only for its contrast to the speeches which he
made afterwards—for its affectation and bluster and imbecility. It
may be easily believed, as is reported of him, that at the time he made
this and other speeches like it, he wore red heels and blue powder,
and was distinguished as the greatest coxcomb in Europe. He was
not then the same figure that I afterwards beheld in the Louvre, with
hairs grown grey in the service of the public, with a face pale and
furrowed with thought, doing honour to the English character as its
best representative, conciliating by his frank, simple, unaffected
manners, the affection and esteem of strangers, and wandering carelessly
and unconsciously among those courts and palaces, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>profound policy and deep-laid machinations he alone, by his wisdom
and the generous openness of his nature, was able to resist. His first
acquaintance with Burke seems to have been the æra of his manhood;
or rather, it was then that he first learned to know himself, and found
his true level. A man in himself is always the same, though he may
not always appear to be so.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir W. Meredith.</span>—This speech discovers true zeal and earnestness.
It seems to belong to an earlier period of our history.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have already said something in praise of his speeches. They
have in them what an old poet calls ‘veins of nature’—a heartfelt
simplicity, before which wit, and elegance, and acuteness, and the
pomp of words, sink into insignificance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. Sawbridge.</span>—Junius praises this city orator and patriot for his
republican firmness. If he is to be taken as a model of the republican
character, he does not, in my opinion, reflect much credit on it. In
the following speech there is all the impudence, indecency, grossness,
and vulgarity, of a factious demagogue. This character, I know not
how, unfortunately sprung up in the beginning of the present reign.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Colonel</span> (afterwards <span class='sc'>Gen.</span>) <span class='sc'>Burgoyne</span> was the natural son of lord
Bingley. His defeat and capture by general Gates determined the
issue of the contest with America. As a writer and a speaker, he
had more success, though he aimed at more than he effected. His
Heiress is a feeble, though a very elegant comedy; and in his speeches,
which are modelled according to the rules of Cicero, his own abilities
and his own modesty take up half of the paper, and the reader’s
attention is equally divided between the speaker and the subject. At
the same time, if they were a little less affected, they would not be
without merit.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. Jenkinson.</span> (<em>The present Earl of Liverpool</em>).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Hon. Temple Luttrel.</span>—I have introduced the following Speech
as an exquisite specimen of unaccountably absurd affectation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. Wilkes</span>, (<em>the Lord Mayor</em>).—This celebrated man was born
in 1728. In 1761, he was elected member for Aylesbury, about
which time he excited the indignation of ministry by publishing a
periodical paper, called the North Briton, for the forty-fifth number
of which he was apprehended by a general warrant. He was however
liberated, and became the patriot of the day. He was soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>after expelled the house for his Essay on Woman. He was
repeatedly returned for Middlesex after this, but the election was
always declared void, till 1774, when he took his seat without
opposition. The following speech in his own defence contains the
clearest, most logical, and best argued case, that has been made out
on that side of the question. He takes the same ground, and often
uses the same words as Junius, but I think he establishes his point
more satisfactorily. He was a clear, correct, able, and eloquent
speaker. His conversational talents were very brilliant. He was a
very ugly and a very debauched man, but a great favourite with the
women, whom he accordingly satirized without mercy. He died
1797.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. Dunning</span>, (<em>afterwards Lord Ashburton</em>,) was born at Ashburton,
in Devonshire, in 1731. After studying some time under his
father, who was an attorney, he entered at the Temple, and on being
called to the bar, soon rose to eminence in his profession: he obtained
a seat in parliament, and became one of the most distinguished
members of opposition at this period. He died 1782. The following
is the most brilliant display of his eloquence that I have met with;
which I was at some pains to pick out from among the shreds and
patches that remain of his speeches. In general, he was neither an
elegant nor an agreeable speaker. His style was dry, harsh, formal,
and pedantic. His legal knowledge is said to have been very great:
but as this is a subject which I do not<a id='t423'></a> understand, I must leave it
to the lawyers to pronounce his panegyric in ‘good set terms’ of
their own.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> (<span class='sc'>Lord</span>) <span class='sc'>Lyttleton</span> succeeded his father in 1773. He
was a young man of great talents, but very profligate in his manners.
He died in 1779, at the age of 35.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>William Pitt</span>, (<em>son of the late Earl of Chatham</em>,) was born in 1759.
He was educated at Cambridge. He entered at Lincoln’s-Inn, and
was called to the bar, where he had not much practice. He was
just returned to parliament for the borough of Appleby. The following
is the first speech he made in the house, on economical reform.
He became chancellor of the exchequer in 1783, which office he
continued till 1801. He then retired, but came in again in 1804,
and continued in that office till his death, January 1806.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. Sheridan.</span>—Richard Brinsley Sheridan, one of the most
brilliant speakers that ever appeared in the house of commons, was
born in 1750. He was known to the public before he came into
parliament, as having written the best comedies of the age. He was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>returned member for Stafford in 1780, which place he continued
to represent till the last election, in 1806, when he succeeded Fox as
member for Westminster. On Fox’s accession to office in the
beginning of the same year, he was appointed treasurer of the navy.
The following is his first speech in the house. He has said more
witty things than ever were said by any one man in the house of
commons: but at present one may say of him, ‘The wine of life is
drunk and but the lees remain.’</p>

<p class='c010'>I have retained the compliment with which the following speech is
prefaced in the report from which it is taken, ‘that it was the most
brilliant reply that perhaps was ever made in the House of Commons,’
because I am half inclined to be of the same opinion. The expression
<em>brilliant</em> belongs peculiarly to Sheridan’s style of eloquence. For
brilliant fancy, for vivacity of description, for animation, for acuteness,
for wit, for good sense and real discrimination, for seeing the question
at once just in the right point of view, being neither perplexed with
the sophisms of others, nor led away by the warmth of his own
imagination, he was (I do not say he is) equal to any of his competitors;
for he has got none left (except indeed Windham, who is
however as different a man as can be). I have made more <em>fuss</em> about
some other speakers, but to say the truth, he is about as good as the
best of them. He was undoubtedly the second public man after Fox,
both with respect to talents, and firmness to his principles.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir George Saville</span>, (<em>Member for Yorkshire</em>,) distinguished
himself by his opposition to the American war, and by bringing in
the bill for the repeal of the penal statutes against the Roman
Catholics. His speeches abound with real wit and humour. He
died 1784, at the age of 59.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. Grattan.</span>—I do not, I confess, like this style, though it is
what many people call eloquent. There is a certain spirit and
animation in it, but it is over-run with affectation. It is at the same
time mechanical, uncouth, and extravagant. It is like a piece of
Gothic architecture, full of quaintness and formality. It is ‘all
horrid’ with climax and alliteration and epithet and personification.
‘From injuries to arms, and from arms to liberty: precedent and
principle, the Irish volunteers, and the Irish parliament.’ I am not
fond of these double facings, and splicings and clenches in style. They
too much resemble a garden laid out according to Pope’s description,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Where each alley has a brother,</div>
      <div class='line'>And half the platform just reflects the other.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span><span class='sc'>Mr. Curran.</span>—This celebrated pleader has been called by some,
who probably intended it as a compliment, the Irish Erskine. I do
not know what the effect of their manner may be, having never heard
them; but this I know, that as to their <em>written</em> speeches, there is no
comparison either with respect to brilliancy or solidity between
Erskine’s speeches and those of Curran. The speeches of the latter
are also free from that affectation, or false glitter, which is the vice
of Irish eloquence. Every Irish orator thinks himself bound to be a
Burke. But according to the old axiom, no man is bound to do that
which he cannot.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. Canning.</span>—This gentleman writes verses better than he makes
speeches. If he had as much understanding as he has wit, he would be
a great man: but that is not the case. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non omnia possumus omnes.</span></i>
However, there is a degree of elegance and brilliancy, and a certain
ambitious tip-toe elevation in his speeches. But they want manliness,
force, and dignity. His eloquence is something like a bright, sharp-pointed
sword, which, owing to its not being made of very stout
metal, bends and gives way, and seems ready to snap asunder at
every stroke; and he is perpetually in danger of having it wrested
out of his hands.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mr. Horne Tooke.</span>—I shall only say of the following speech that
it is worthy of the celebrated man by whom it was delivered.</p>

    well written sentence, in all the long, dreary, heavy columns of <cite>The Times</cite>
    newspaper. But as our author cannot soar, he grovels; and no one ever sunk so low. He is
    a perfect Grub-street. His want of eloquence renders him abusive; he has no power over
    <em>words</em>, or he would not call <em>names</em> at the rate he does. He throws dirt
    and rubbish at the heads of his adversaries, because he can get nothing else to throw. Do
    you think he would go on for ever with that round of slang-phrases, dreadful to the ear,
    and petrific even to behold; monstrous, prodigious, unutterable, without argument,
    without sense or decency, calculated only to stupify or disgust, with which he piles up
    the columns of <cite>The Times</cite> newspaper, if he had any resources either of
    imagination or understanding? It is the want of power equal to his will, that inflames
    his malice and inflates his style; he makes up for what he wants in strength, by
    coarseness; for what he wants in variety, by repetition; for what he wants in sallies of
    wit, by systematic dulness; for what he wants in reason, by brutal outrage. And then, did
    any mortal ever read such a style? The flowers of Billingsgate, arranged according to the
    rules of Lindley Murray’s English Exercises, with all the ridiculous pedantry of
    subjunctive moods and adverbial expletives:

    All that is low in understanding, vulgar and sordid in principle in city politics, is
    seen exuding from the formal jaws of <cite>The Times</cite> newspaper, as we see the
    filth, and slime, and garbage, and offal of this great city pouring into the Thames, from
    the sewers and conduit-pipes of the scavenger’s company. It is a patent water-closet for
    the dirty uses of legitimacy: a leaden cistern for obsolete prejudices and upstart
    sophistry “to knot and gender in.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' style='text-decoration:
    none; '><sup>[71]</sup></a> Is this an exaggerated account? No. We have not words to do
    justice to the subject. <cite>The Times</cite> newspaper is a phenomenon without any
    parallel in history: it is the triumph of the reign of George <span
    class='fss'>III.</span> It is supposed to be the organ of the Stock Exchange politics;
    and, to be sure, there is a wonderful sympathy between them. Neither Burke nor Junius
    would have done so well. There is nothing in the pages of <cite>The Times</cite> that can
    lose in loftiness or elegance by repetition in the money-market, or draw off the
    attention of the bulls and bears from their ledgers, or their soups and venison. The
    vulgarity of the Editor’s style might even receive a romantic tincture from the Hebraism
    of its pronunciation, and its monotony would be agreeably relieved by the discordant
    gabble of that disinterested congregation of stock-jobbing Jews and Gentiles. The secret
    of the composition of <cite>The Times</cite> is this. The city wants a bugbear to suit
    their interest, and the Editor of the city paper creates a bugbear out of his malice. He
    nicknames this bugbear, but as he does not believe in it, he repeats his nickname ten or
    a dozen times every day, till by so doing he begins to believe it. They begin to believe
    it too; and the echo and buz of the Stock Exchange gives him courage to go on. He then
    tries other and more odious nicknames, which he and others believe, not <span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>because
    they are true, but because they are odious, and gratify the malice of the writer, and
    answer the readers’ ends. Thus the city and the city Editor go on hand in hand, creating
    a bugbear out of nothing, and swelling it into a monster, heaping all sorts of vices and
    deformities upon it, and believing them all, in proportion as they are incredible and
    contradictory—if they are disproved, repeating them the louder—making the disgust, fear
    and hatred, which their bugbear inspires, a proof of its existence, and determined more
    and more to indulge their disgust, fear and hatred, in proportion as their passions and
    prejudices have no other foundation than their own spite and credulity—drowning reason in
    passion—overcoming common sense, by shocking common decency—believing in the chimeras of
    their own brain, from their very hideousness, as children put faith in apparitions, in
    proportion to their dread of them—ringing everlastingly in each other’s ears, what they
    each wish to believe; and believing that there is some reason for the everlasting din and
    noise they make, because they make it—creating a war-bugbear, because they wanted
    something to go to war with, requiring the same wanton and unprincipled sacrifices of the
    blood and treasure of their country to be made to this phantom of their own making, as to
    the direst necessity; and persisting in the justice and wisdom of their measures, from
    the very miseries which these helpmates of the Bourbons have brought upon the world—to
    gratify the mercantile avarice of the Stock Exchange and the literary vanity of its tool,
    the Editor of <cite>The Times</cite>. The interest of the Stock Exchange, and the
    philosophy of the Editor of <cite>The Times</cite>, no longer, however, draw the same way
    and we suspect they will soon dissolve partnership. Such writers do their country best
    service in the end; “kept like an apple in the jaw of an ape, first mouthed, and last
    swallowed: it is but squeezing them, and spunge, you shall be dry again.”<a id='r72' /><a

    mockery of divine right, this spurious offspring of the foul blatant Beast, back on the
    French that has been the cause, the end and origin, of all this mischief: and it was for
    having kept it in check for so many years by his valour and genius, for having put a hook
    in its nostrils, and made it lower its grisly crest, and cease its horrid roar, and
    retire to its obscure, obscene den, that Buonaparte was nicknamed by the two celebrated

    <dd>In <cite>The Yellow Dwarf</cite> Hazlitt concluded as follows:—‘Happy are they, who live
    in the dream of their own existence, and see all things by the light of their own minds:
    who walk by faith and hope, not by knowledge; to whom the guiding star of their youth
    still shines from afar, and into whom the spirit of the world has not entered! They have
    not been ‘hurt by the archers,’<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' style='text-decoration: none;
    '><sup>[73]</sup></a> nor has the iron entered into their souls. They live in the midst
    of arrows and of death, unconscious of harm. The evil thing comes not nigh them. The
    shafts of ridicule pass unheeded by, and malice loses its sting. The example of vice does
    not rankle in their breasts, like the poisoned shirt of Nessus. Evil impressions fall off
    from them, like drops of water. The yoke of life is to them light and supportable. The
    world has no hold on them. They are in it, not of it; and a dream and a glory is ever
    about them.’ Cf. Hazlitt’s <cite>Reply to Malthus</cite>, vol. <span

    <dd><em>That is an automaton.</em> In <cite>The Eloquence of the British Senate</cite>
    Hazlitt has the following note to this passage: ‘I ought to beg pardon of the polite
    reader for thus rudely contrasting these two celebrated men and leaders of parties
    together. It has of late become more fashionable to consider them in the light of the
    United Friends. But as I am no sign-painter, I hope I may be excused for not adhering
    exactly to the <em>costume</em> of the times. This agreeable idea might however, if
    skilfully executed, be improved into a very appropriate sign for the tap-room of the
    house of commons. My Lord Howick the other day drew a pleasing picture of them
    <em>shaking hands in Elysium</em>. It must be owned that this is pretty and poetical.
    Happy, well assorted pair! Methinks I see you, bowing to one another, with repeated
    assurances of friendship and esteem, but half believed, just like—lord Grenville and lord
    Howick in the park! This was probably what his lordship had in his mind at the time: but
    as our <em>young</em> orators generally love to shew that they have <em>read</em> the
    classics, so perhaps his lordship was willing to shew that he had not <em>forgot</em>
    them. It is pleasing to see great men sweetening the cares of state with the flowers of
    poetical allusion; condescending to turn with a benign countenance from the serious
    realities of life, to the lighter scenes of fable and romance; still wandering, (as in
    their boyish days) with Dido and Æneas, and taking an imaginary trip from Downing Street
    to the Elysian Fields, and from the Elysian Fields back again! After all, I do not know
    that it would be any disgrace to Mr. Fox to associate with Mr. Pitt in the other world,
    if we recollect the company he kept in this. Lord H—— I believe, on the same occasion,
    quoted Dryden, and compared the late duke of Brunswick to Darius. Really, his lordship’s
    researches in poetry are astonishing; they are almost as extensive and profound as his
    knowledge of the affairs of Europe, or of the fate of battles! There is some excuse,
    however, for this last mentioned quotation, as though the passage quoted was by no means
    new in itself, yet the particular application of it must certainly have been very new to
    his lordship’s mind, and one which the public might not have been disposed to give him
    credit for without some positive evidence. To complete the solemnity of the scene,
    nothing more was wanting but for the whole house to have joined chorus in this affecting
    and well known specimen of elegiac sadness, particularly as it had been already set to
    music, one would suppose for this very purpose.’

    Supply, Aug. 5, 1625 (<cite>Parl. Hist.</cite> <span class='fss'>II.</span> 11.). On a
    phrase of Coke’s ‘to petition the King rather for a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">logique</span></i> than a
    <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rhetorique</span></i> hand,’ Hazlitt has the following note: ‘This mode of expression
    seems natural enough to any one who was familiar with Cicero’s description of the
    difference between logic and rhetoric, and who knew that most of his hearers either were,
    or would be thought, equally learned. It was a convenient short-hand language to those
    who were hardly ever accustomed to think or speak but in classical allusions, and which
    no one could affect to misunderstand without first exposing his own ignorance:—it was a
    sort of <em>word to the wise</em>. So that its being abrupt and far-fetched would be a
    recommendation of it, and would even give it an air of simplicity with men of deep
    learning, as being more in the way of their habitual and favourite train of ideas. But
    this stile, which may be called the abstruse or pedantic, is soon exploded when knowledge
    becomes more generally diffused, and the pretension to it universal: when there are few
    persons who profess to be very learned, and none are contented to be thought entirely
    ignorant; when every one who can read is a critic; when the reputation of taste and good
    sense is not confined to an acquaintance with the Greek and Latin authors, and it is not
    thought necessary to a man’s understanding an eloquent discourse, or even to his making
    one, that he should ever have read a definition either of logic or rhetoric.’

    <dd>‘Sir Robert here, by entirely leaving out the consideration of the other parts of our

    part, very ingeniously models the house of commons according to his own wishes, and at
    the same time in such a manner as to answer the purposes of all the other parts, and in
    fact to render them unnecessary. It has always been pretended that the house of commons
    was but one branch of the legislative—the representative of the people; and that an
    antidote to any evils that might arise from this part of the system was wisely provided
    in the other branches, which were to represent property and power; but care has been
    taken to make sure of the remedy in the first instance, namely by inoculating the patient
    before the disease was caught, and making the house of commons itself never anything more
    than the representative of property and power.’

    <dd>410. To Heathcote’s speech, which was on the Establishment of Excise Officers, Hazlitt
    has the following note: ‘The introduction of the excise laws excited an immense ferment
    through the kingdom about this time. It was called by Pulteney, ‘that monster, the
    Excise.’ And Walpole had more difficulty in weathering the storm of opposition that rose
    on this occasion, than on any other. How tame are we grown!  How familiar with that
    slavery and ruin, threatened us by so many succeeding prophets and politicians! We play
    with the bugbears, and handle them, and do not find that they hurt us. We look back and
    smile at the disproportionate resistance of our inexperienced forefathers to petty
    vexations and imaginary grievances, and are like the old horse in the fable, who wondered
    at the folly of the young horse, who refused even to be saddled, while he crouched

    <dd>‘The following arguments towards the conclusion of this speech are so sensible, so

    though I did not at first intend it. Burke’s speeches are to me, in this my parliamentary
    progress, what the Duke’s castle was to Sancho: I could be content to stay there longer
    than I am able. I have no inclination to leave the stately palaces, the verdant lawns,
    the sumptuous entertainments, the grave discourse, and pleasing sounds of music, to sally
    forth in search of bad roads, meagre fare, and barren adventures. Charles Fox is indeed
    to come; but he is but the Knight of the Green Surtout. Pitt is the brazen head, that

    <dd>‘Thus was this great man, merely for disclaiming metaphysical distinctions and shewing
    their inapplicability to practical questions, considered as an unintelligible reasoner;
    as if you were chargeable with the very folly of which you convict others. Burke
    understood metaphysics, and knew their true boundaries: when he saw others venturing
    blindly upon this treacherous ground, and called out to them to stop, shewing them where
    they were, they said, this man is a metaphysician. General unqualified assertions,
    universal axioms, and abstract rules serve to embody our prejudices; they <span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>are
    the watch-words of party, the strong-holds of the passions. It is therefore dangerous to
    meddle with them. Solid reason means nothing more than being carried away by our

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. One instance may serve as an example for all the rest:—When Mr. Fox last
summer predicted the failure of the new confederacy against France, from a
consideration of the circumstances and relative situation of both parties, that is,
from an exact knowledge of the actual state of the case, Mr. Pitt contented
himself with answering—and, as in the blindness of his infatuation he seemed to
think quite satisfactorily,—‘That he could not assent to the honourable gentleman’s
reasoning, for that it went to this, that we were never to attempt to mend the
situation of our affairs, because in so doing we might possibly make them worse.’
No; it was not on account of this abstract possibility in human affairs, or because
we were not absolutely sure of succeeding (for that any child might know), but
because it was in the highest degree probable, or <em>morally</em> certain that the scheme
would fail, and leave us in a worse situation than we were before, that Mr. Fox
disapproved of the attempt. There is in this a degree of weakness and imbecility,
a defect of understanding bordering on idiotism, a fundamental ignorance of the
first principles of human reason and prudence, that in a great minister is utterly
astonishing, and almost incredible. Nothing could ever drive him out of his dull
forms, and naked generalities; which as they are susceptible neither of degree nor
variation, are therefore equally applicable to every emergency that can happen:
and in the most critical aspect of affairs he saw nothing but the same flimsy web
of remote possibilities and metaphysical uncertainty. In his mind the wholesome
pulp of practical wisdom and salutary advice was immediately converted into the
dry chaff and husks of a miserable logic.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. I would recommend to the reader a masterly and unanswerable essay on this
subject in the Morning Post, by Mr. Coleridge, in February 1800, from which, and
the conversation of the author, most of the above remarks are taken. I will only
add, that it is the property of true genius to force the admiration even of enemies.
No one was ever hated or envied for his powers of mind, if others were convinced
of their real excellence. The jealousy and uneasiness produced in the mind by the
display of superior talents almost always arises from a suspicion that there is some
trick or deception in the case, and that we are imposed on by an appearance of
what is not really there. True warmth and vigour communicate warmth and
vigour; and we are no longer inclined to dispute the inspiration of the oracle,
when we feel the ‘presens Divus’ in our own bosoms. But when, without
gaining any new light or heat, we only find our ideas thrown into perplexity and
confusion by an art that we cannot comprehend, this is a kind of superiority which
must always be painful, and can never be cordially admitted. For this reason the
extraordinary talents of Mr. Pitt were always viewed, except by those of his own
party, with a sort of jealousy, and <em>grudgingly</em> acknowledged; while those of his
rivals were admitted by all parties in the most unreserved manner, and carried by
acclamation.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. Mr. Burke pretends in this Jesuitical Appeal, that a nation has a right to
insist upon and revert to old establishments and prescriptive privileges, but not to
lay claim to new ones; in a word, to change its governors, if refractory, but not
its form of government, however bad. Thus he says we had a right to cashier
James <span class='fss'>II.</span>, because he wished to alter the laws and religion as they were then
established. By what right did we emancipate ourselves from popery and
arbitrary power a century before? He defends his consistency in advocating the
American Revolution, though the rebels, in getting rid of the reigning branch of
the Royal Family, did not send for the next of kin to rule over them ‘in contempt
of their choice,’ but prevented all such equivocations by passing at once from a
viceroyalty to a republic. He also extols the Polish Revolution as a monument of
wisdom and virtue (I suppose because it had not succeeded), though this also was a
total and absolute change in the frame and principles of the government, to which
the people were in this case bound by no feudal tenure or divine right. But he
insists that the French Revolution was stark-naught, because the people here did
the same thing, passed from slavery to liberty, from an arbitrary to a constitutional
government, to which they had, it seems, no prescriptive right, and therefore,
according to the appellant, no right at all. Oh nice professor of humanity! We
had a right to turn off James <span class='fss'>II.</span> because he broke a compact with the people.
The French had no right to turn off Louis <span class='fss'>XVI.</span> because he broke no compact
with them, for he had none to break; in other words, because he was an arbitrary
despot, tied to no laws, and they a herd of slaves, and therefore they were bound,
by every law divine and human, always to remain so, in perpetuity and by the
grace of God! Oh unanswerable logician!</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. There is none of this perplexity and jarring of different objects in the tools
of power. Their jealousies, heart-burnings, love of precedence, or scruples of
conscience, are made subservient to the great cause in which they are embarked;
they leave the amicable division of the spoil to the powers that be; all angry
disputes are hushed in the presence of the throne, and the corrosive, fretful particles
of human nature fly off, and are softened by the influence of a court atmosphere.
Courtiers hang together like a swarm of bees about a honeycomb. Not so the
Reformers; for they have no honeycomb to attract them. It has been said that
Reformers are often indifferent characters. The reason is, that the ties which bind
most men to their duties—habit, example, regard to appearances—are relaxed in
them; and other and better principles are, as yet, weak and unconfirmed.</p>

the next day in the <cite>Chronicle</cite> with the following remarks:—‘The treasury journals

Admiralty <em>Croaker</em>, it is a close imitation of his style.’</p>

better in the East (it is to be hoped we shall do so in time here); otherwise, if
there had been any occasion, what pretty Anti-Jacobin sonnets might not Mr.
Canning have written in praise of this Jaggernaut? Or Mr. Southey, after in vain
attempting its overthrow, might have ‘spun his brains’ into a <span class='sc'>Carmen Annuum</span> to
celebrate his own defeat. Or Vetus might play off his discovery of the identity of
the strumpet and the goddess Reason, against any disposition to disarm its power
or arrest its progress.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. Of the facility of realising this devout aspiration of the writer in <cite>The Times</cite>,
we have no exact means of judging by his own statements, for he one day tells
us that ‘there is <em>nothing</em> to hinder Lord Wellington from marching to Paris, and
bringing the Usurper to the block,’ and the next endeavours to excite the panic
fears of his readers, by telling them, in a tone of equal horror and dismay, ‘That
the <em>monster</em> wields at will the force of forty millions of men.’ The assertions of
these writers have no connection with the real state of things, but depend entirely
on their variable passions, and the purpose they have in view.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. We only wish to add one thing, which is, to protest against the self-importance
of such expressions as the following, which occur often in Vetus’s letters:—‘<em>The
men I speak of were</em>’ those, &amp;c. ‘This sentiment never prevailed with <em>the better
sort</em>.’ This is an affectation of the worst part of Burke’s style, his assumption of a
parliamentary tone, and of the representation of the voice of some corporate body.
It was bad enough in him; in Vetus it is intolerable.</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. This article falls somewhat short of its original destination, by our having
been forced to omit two topics, the praise of Bonaparte, and the abuse of
poetry. The former we leave to history: the latter we have been induced to
omit from our regard to two poets of our acquaintance. We must say they
have spoiled sport. One of them has tropical blood in his veins, which gives
a gay, cordial, vinous spirit to his whole character. The other is a mad wag,—who
ought to have lived at the Court of Horwendillus, with Yorick and
Hamlet,—equally desperate in his mirth and his gravity, who would laugh at a
funeral and weep at a wedding, who talks nonsense to prevent the headache,
who would wag his finger at a skeleton, whose jests scald like tears, who makes
a joke of a great man, and a hero of a cat’s paw. The last is more than Mr.
Garrard or Mr. Turnerelli can do. The busts which these gentlemen have made
of a celebrated General are very bad. His head is worth nothing unless it is put
on his men’s shoulders.</p>

In this he was consistent and logical. Could he not, however, find out another
example of this same principle, by going a little farther back in history, and
coming a little nearer home? If he has forgotten this chapter in our history,
others who have profited more by it have not. He may understand what we

<p class='c010'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. During the retreat, the king was ever seen where the danger was greatest.
Foremost in the ranks, he continually charged the Austrians in person. When
his affairs grew desperate, it became evident that he sought for death in the field.
At the head of a few of his cavalry, whom he constantly preceded, he often
charged the enemy to their very cannons’ mouth. How he escaped amidst so
many dangers appears miraculous. He might well say that ‘he had sought death,
but had not been able to find it.’</p>

fortune-hunting, dastard, busy, hungry, heartless slaves and blood-suckers, eager to
fawn upon power and trample upon weakness, with no other pretensions than want
of principle, and a hatred of those who possess what they want. Ireland has given

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f35'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r35'>35</a>. Of the three persons that Mr. Coleridge, by a most preposterous anachronism,
has selected to compose his asinine auditory, Mr. Hunt was at the time in question
a boy at school, not <em>a stripling bard</em> of nineteen or nine and twenty, but a real
school-boy ‘declaiming on the patriotism of Brutus.’ As to Mr. Cobbett, he would
at that time, had they come in his way, with one kick of his hard hoofs, have
made a terrible crash among ‘the green corn’ of Mr. Southey’s Jacobin Pan’s-pipe,
and gone near to knock out the musician’s brains into the bargain. The second
person in this absurd trinity, who certainly thinks it ‘a robbery to be made equal
to the other two,’ was the only hearer present at the rehearsal of Mr. Southey’s
overtures to Liberty and Equality, and to that ‘long-continued asinine bravura,’
which rings in Mr. Coleridge’s ears, but which certainly was not unaccompanied,
for he himself was present; and those who know this gentleman, know that on
these occasions he plays the part of a whole chorus.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f36'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r36'>36</a>. A sarcastic writer, like Mr. Southey, might here ask, whether it was a disappointment
in sharing the estate of some rich landed proprietor that made
Mr. Southey turn short round to a defence of sinecures and pensions? We do not
know, but here follows a passage, which ‘some skulking scoundrel’ in the
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite> appears to have aimed at Mr. Southey’s early opinions and
character:—‘As long as the smatterer in philosophy confines himself to private
practice, the mischief does not extend beyond his private circle—his neighbour’s
wife may be in some danger, and his neighbour’s property also; if the distinctions
between <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">meum</span></i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuum</span></i> should be practically inconvenient to the man of free
opinions. But when he commences professor of moral and political philosophy
for the benefit of the public—the fables of old credulity are then verified, his very
breath becomes venomous, and every page which he sends abroad carries with it
poison to the unsuspicious reader.’ Such is the interpretation given by the
anonymous writer to the motives of smatterers in philosophy; this writer could
not be Mr. Southey, for ‘<em>he</em> never imputes evil motives to men merely for holding
the opinions he formerly held,’ such as the evils of the inequality of property, &amp;c.</p>

it is the people, and not the Pope, who wants reforming.</p>

we have them in our power, that is the principle of all cruelty and tyranny.
Our pride takes a pleasure in the sufferings our malice has inflicted; every
aggravation of their case is a provocation to new injuries and insults; and their
pretensions to justice or mercy become ridiculous in proportion to their hopelessness
of redress. It was thus that Mother Brownrigg whipped her prentices to
death; and in the same manner our facetious Editor would work himself up to
apply the thumb-screw to any one who was unable to resist the application, with a
few ‘forsooths,’ and other such ‘comfit-makers wives’ oaths.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f41'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r41'>41</a>. That he might be deemed so no longer, Mr. <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span> soon after became
<em>passionate for war</em> himself; and ‘swell’d the war-whoop’ in the Morning Post. ‘I
am not indeed silly enough,’ he says, ‘to take as any thing more than a violent
hyperbole of party debate, Mr. <span class='sc'>Fox</span>‘s assertion that <em>the late war</em> (1802) <em>was a war
produced by the</em> <span class='sc'>Morning Post</span>; or I should be proud to have the words inscribed

had only fourpence left in the world, which his wife had put by to pay for the
baking of some meat and a pudding, went and laid it out in purchasing a new
string for a guitar. Some on this occasion quoted the lines,</p>

worthy attempts, as that they suffered themselves to be the common stales to
countenance, with their prostituted gravities, every politick fetch that was then on
foot, as oft as the potent Statists pleased to employ them. Never do we read
that they made use of their authority, and high place of access, to bring the
jarring nobility to Christian peace, or to withstand their disloyal projects: but
if a toleration for Mass were to be begged of the King for his sister Mary, lest
Charles the Fifth should be angry, who but the grave prelates, <em>Cranmer</em> and <em>Ridley</em>,
must be sent to extort it from the young King! But out of the mouth of that
godly and royal child, Christ himself returned such an awful repulse to those
halting and time-serving Prelates, that, after much importunity they went their
way, not without shame and tears.’—<em>Milton</em>—<cite>Of Reformation in England, and the

<div class='footnote' id='f51'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r51'>51</a>. ‘I have thought it prudent to omit some parts of Mr. Phelim Connor’s letter.
He is evidently an intemperate young man, and has associated with his cousins,
the Fudges, to very little purpose.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f52'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r52'>52</a>. ‘Somebody (Fontenelle, I believe) has said, that if he had his hand full of
truths, he would open but one finger at a time; and I find it necessary to use the
same sort of reserve with respect to Mr. Phelim Connor’s very plain-spoken
letters. The remainder of this Epistle is so full of unsafe matter of fact, that it
must, for the present at least, be withheld from the public.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f53'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r53'>53</a>. ‘To commemorate the landing of Louis le Desiré from England, the impression
of his foot is marked out upon the pier at Calais, and a pillar with an
inscription raised opposite to the spot.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f54'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r54'>54</a>. This character was written in a fit of extravagant candour, at a time when I
thought I could do justice, or more than justice, to an enemy, without betraying a
cause.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f55'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r55'>55</a>. For instance: he produced less effect on the mob that compose the English
House of Commons than Chatham or Fox, or even Pitt.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f56'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r56'>56</a>. As in the comparison of the British Constitution to the ‘proud keep of
Windsor,’ &amp;c. the most splendid passage in his works.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f57'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r57'>57</a>. If I had to write a character of Mr. Fox at present, the praise here bestowed on
him would be ‘craftily qualified.’ His life was deficient in the three principal
points, the beginning, the middle, and the end. He began a violent Tory, and
became a flaming patriot out of private <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">picque</span>; he afterwards coalesced with Lord
North, and died an accomplice with Lord Grenville. But—<em>what I have written, I
have written</em>. So let it pass.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f58'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r58'>58</a>. See an excellent character of Fox by a celebrated and admirable writer, which
appeared in the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, November, 1806, from which this passage is
taken as nearly as I could recollect it.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f59'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r59'>59</a>. There is an admirable, judicious, and truly useful remark in the preface to
Spenser (not by Dr. Johnson, for he left Spenser out of his poets, but by <em>one</em>
Upton,) that the question was not whether a better poem might not have been
written on a different plan, but whether Spenser would have written a better one
on a different plan. I wish to apply this to Fox’s <em>ungainly</em> manner. I do not
mean to say, that his manner was the best possible, (for that would be to say that
he was the greatest man conceivable), but that it was the best for him.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f60'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r60'>60</a>. This may seem to contradict what I have before said of Chatham—that he
spoke like a man who was discharging a duty, &amp;c. but I there spoke of the tone
he assumed, or his immediate feelings at the time, rather than of the real motives
by which he was actuated.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f61'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r61'>61</a>. To this character none of those who could be compared with him in
talents had the least pretensions, as Chatham, Burke, Pitt, &amp;c. They would
<em>blackguard</em> and bully any man upon the slightest provocation, or difference
of opinion.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f62'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r62'>62</a>. One instance may serve as an example for all the rest:—When Mr. Fox last
summer (1805) predicted the failure of the new confederacy against France, from
a consideration of the circumstances and relative situation of both parties, that is,
from an exact knowledge of the actual state of things, Mr. Pitt contented himself
with answering—and, as in the blindness of his infatuation, he seemed to think
quite satisfactorily,—‘That he could not assent to the honourable gentleman’s
reasoning, for that it went to this, that we were never to attempt to mend the
situation of our affairs, because in so doing we might possibly make them worse.’
No; it was not on account of this abstract possibility in human affairs, or because
we were not absolutely sure of succeeding (for that any child might know), but
because it was in the highest degree probable, or <em>morally</em> certain, that the scheme
would fail, and leave us in a worse situation than we were before, that Mr. Fox
disapproved of the attempt. There is in this a degree of weakness and imbecility,
a defect of understanding bordering on idiotism, a fundamental ignorance of the
first principles of human reason and prudence, that in a great minister is utterly
astonishing, and almost incredible. Nothing could ever drive him out of his dull
forms, and naked generalities; which, as they are susceptible neither of degree nor
variation, are therefore equally applicable to every emergency that can happen:
and in the most critical aspect of affairs, he saw nothing but the same flimsy web
of remote possibilities and metaphysical uncertainty. In his mind the wholesome
pulp of practical wisdom and salutary advice was immediately converted into the
dry chaff and husks of a miserable logic.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f63'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r63'>63</a>. I do remember one passage which has some meaning in it. At the time of
the Regency Bill, speaking of the proposal to take the King’s servants from him,
he says, ‘What must that great personage feel when he waked from the trance of
his faculties, and asked for his attendants, if he were told that his subjects had
taken advantage of his momentary absence of mind, and stripped him of the
symbols of his personal elevation.’ There is some grandeur in this. His admirers
should have it inscribed in letters of gold; for they will not find another instance
of the same kind.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f64'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r64'>64</a>. I would recommend to the reader a masterly and unanswerable essay on the
subject, in the Morning Post, by Mr. Coleridge, (see above) from which most of
the above remarks are taken. See also Dr. Beddoes’s Letter on the public merits
of Mr. Pitt. I will only add, that it is the property of true genius, to force
the admiration even of enemies. No one was ever hated or envied for his powers
of mind, if others were convinced of their real excellence. The jealousy and uneasiness
produced in the mind by the display of superior talents almost always arises
from a suspicion that there is some trick or deception in the case, and that we are
imposed on by an appearance of what is not really there. True warmth and vigour
communicate warmth and vigour; and we are no longer inclined to dispute the
inspiration of the oracle, when we feel the ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">presens Divus</span></i>’ in our own bosoms.
But when, without gaining any new light or heat, we only find our ideas thrown
into perplexity and confusion by an art that we cannot comprehend, this is a kind
of superiority which must always be painful, and can never be cordially admitted.
For this reason the extraordinary talents of Mr. Pitt were always viewed, except
by those of his own party, with a sort of jealousy, and <em>grudgingly</em> acknowledged;
while those of his rivals were admitted by all parties in the most unreserved manner,
and carried by acclamation.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f65'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r65'>65</a>. The prevalence of this check may be estimated <em>by the general proportion</em> of
virtue and happiness in the world, for if there were no such check, there could be
nothing but vice and misery.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f66'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r66'>66</a>. Written in 1807, at a time when Mr. Whitbread’s scheme was in agitation in
the House of Commons, and Mr. Malthus used to wait in the lobbies with his
essay in his hand, for the instruction and compliments of Honourable Members.
The above article is taken from a Reply to Mr. Malthus, one of my very early
Essays, the style of which is, I confess, a little exuberant, but of the arguments I
see no reason to be ashamed.</p>

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
